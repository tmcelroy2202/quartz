we selected a location and we did 5 samples from it each of us and now we compile as a class into one larger overarching thing:

in 30 /85 of our homes there was evidence of high lead content in thte water 

is there convincing evidence that the water system in flint is unsafe ? 

choose and check:
// wrong procedure: One sample z interval per proportion
procedure : one sample z test 
parameter: ( what we are predicting ) p = Actual proportion of homes with unsafe lead levels 
Hypotheses: H0 which is our null hypothesis 
h0 is assuming nothing is wrong nothing is skewed evrything is right
h0 will always be equal to something 
h0 is 10% 
if everything is fine h0 should be 10%

ha ( a stands for alternative ) ( what if things are not fine ) = or > or < you are trying to prove its somehow different from null hypothesis

our hypothesis s ha > 0.1 

always 2 hypothesis
null hypothesis is h0: p = 0.1 
alternative hypothesis is ha: p > 0.1 

Significance level: If something happens and there is a less than 5 % chance of it happening by chance then its significant. its usually 5% 

Statistic ( comes from our sample ) ( a number, a proportion ): phat = 30/85  = 0.353
Evidence for Ha: why do we think something is wrong
0.353 is greater than 0.1 



Check the appropriate conditions:
Sample is random - we used a random flint home generator - > so we can generalize to all flint homes 
10% - the sample ( 85 homes ) is less than 10% of all homes in flint im sure -  > so we can find SD 
large counts condition - we have more than 10 successes ( houses with lead ) and more than 10 failures ( houses without lead ) - > so we can know shape is normal 

Calculate:
General Formula:
point estimate +- margin of error
Specific Formula:
phat +- z* sqrt((phat(1-p)/n)) 
.353 +- 

for one popultaion :
mean for phat is p 

z = phat - p / sqrt((p(1-p)/n))
z = 0.353-0.1 / sqrt((.1*.9)/)
7.78 = test statistic  = z 
N(0,1) drawing

p value :


Substitute Numbers:

Picture:
N(0,1) drawing

Test Statistic:
7.78 = test statistic  = z 

P-Value:
assuming null hypothesis ( h0 ) is true, there is a 0% probability of getting a sample proportion of 0.353 or more purely by chance 

Conclude ( in context of the problem ):

since 0 is less than 5%, we reject h0. We have convincing evidence that the actual proportion of homes in flint with high lead levels is more than 0.1
