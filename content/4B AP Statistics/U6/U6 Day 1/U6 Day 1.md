Given a large number of things you can take a random sample. we know this.
parameter: measurement of an entire population. 
your statistic is an exact numer cause she has beads
we dont know parameter
it is you describing parameter 
so parameter for this is gonna be the actual proportion of green beads
i just wrote out "actual proportion of green beads"

one of the groups being 0.03 - 0.19 as an an interval
i subtracted 3 from 19
this got me 0.16
then i divided by 2
this got me 0.08
this is their margin of error
i then took 0.03 and added 0.08 to it
this got me 0.11 
this was their point estimate
minimum + margin of error = point estimate

# Vocab:
* Point estimate: 
	* the proportion of green in the jar is the point estimate
	* not how you feel 
	* another way of saying statistic
	* Why another word for it?
		* They like to make her angry
	* word is interchangeable with statistic
* Population:
	* 2000 beads in the jar we want to know about
		* notation: p 
* Sample:
	* how many beads is in your little bucket you scooped out of the jar
* Parameter:
	* True proportion of green beads in the entire jar.
* Statistic:
	* .125 
		* Notation: p with a hat 
* Margin of error:
	* Wiggle room.
	* We are allowing ourselves to be a little bit wrong.
* Interval notation:
	* (.007, .107) 
	* every confidence interval is an interval so we do this notation 

As long as your interval captures the real point you want then your interval is good. 


How did you determine

learn what it me

what percent confident you were in question 5?

you will use the applet at bit.ly/exploreC! to

and the sample size  to say we are “95% confident.”

8. Set the population proportion and 
the sample size to 75.

portion to 0.5, the confidence level to 95% and

9. Click “Sample” to choose an SRS and display the resulting confidence
interval. The confidence interval is displayed as a horizontal line
segment with a dot representing the sample proportion in the

middle of the interval. The true proportion (p) is the green vertical
line.

this surprising? Why?

11. Watch your confidence intervals as you
from 95% to 99% (don’t “Reset”). What happens to the intervals :
when the confidence level is increased? Why does this make sense?

Interpret the confidence level:

Change the sample to 20 and samp
250 and sample for 1 interval. Wha
the sample size is increased? Why?

if you increase the level of confidence you increase the width of your interval.

interval width decreases because the larger the sample size the less variety you will have  when going from 20 - 250 sample size.

if we take many mant samples and create a confidence interval for each we can expect about 95% of them to capture the true population proportion - this is the interpretation of a confidence interval
if im 95% confident of something then that saying if i make a bunch of intervals i expect 95% of those intervals to correctly capture the true in this case proportion that i was looking for.

The PE teacher of a large high scohol wants to estimate the mean number of pushups students at this school can do in one minute. He selects a sample of 30 students fomr those who are there after school for sports practicies. He records how many  pushups each student in the sample can do in one minute. He determines that he is 90% confident that hte interval from 24.1 to 28.5 captures the mean numbre of pushups that students at this school can do in one minute 

confidence level 90% 
confidence interval (24.1, 28.5)

We are 90% confident that the interval from 24.1 to 28.5 captures the true mean numbre of pushups that his schools students can do in 1 minute 

If we take many many samples and make a confidence interval for each we expect about 90% of them will capture the true mean

point estimate 
26.3
margin of error 2.2

interval would become wider if the confidence level were 99% 

a 90% confidence interval based on a sample size of 200 would be much much less wide

one potential source of bias is that these are all people at sports practices and are not representative of pushup counts across the whole school.
