What percent of data is located between 15 and 25 
68% cause its normal caues it says N(20,5)
what percent of data is more than 30 
2.5% 
the middle 80% of data lie between what 2 values 
13.6 and 26.4 

to find middle 80% :
invNorm(.10,20,5) ( tells you the botom 10%, and then do it again to get the upper.)

interpret z = 1.3
What is 1.3 standard deviations above the mean 

Where have we been and where are we going?
We learned...
95% of data in a normal distribution falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean

Well use it
as a critical value to determine the width of confidence intervals 

We learned...
that random sampling allow sus to generalize results from a sample to an entire population

We learned...
that selecting a sample that is less than 10% of the population lets us ensure independence

Well use that...
to conduct studies where we select participants without replacement

We've learned...
that ensuring independence is one of the key factors in determining if a variable is binomial

well use it...
to calculate standard deviations of binomial distributions

We've learned...
the large counts condition - that if the number of successes and failures of a binomial variable is atleast 10 we can model it with a normal distribution.

Well use it 
to create normal distributions ofr variables with unknown parameters

trying to guess a thing
pick a sample
get a value from that sample ( called a statistic )
make sure its random so it can be generalized ( the sample)
make sure we can use the binomial formula and make sure its independant
we did select less than 10% for our sample so we can
we would like to do normal stuff but we ran into trouble so we must proceed with caution 
we pretended like it was for the next question
found a critical value
put it all together 
answer with an asterisk \* may not be reliable because it was not Normal
