Among iphone users whoshare their data with Apple, the weekly screen time is skewed to the right with M = 13.5 hours and o = 3.75 hours. A random sample of 100 iPhone users are selected and the mean weekly screen time (xhat) of the sample is calculated

Describe the shape of the sampling distribution ( x) for samples of 100 randomly selecte diphone users. justify your answer. 
Approx Normal becaues the sample size is large enough ( 100 >= 30 )

Find the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of (x) be sure to check the 10% condition 
10% cond
100 <= 10% ( millions of people )

Mx = M = 13.5 hours
ox = o/sqrt(n) = 3.75/sqrt(100) = 0.375 hours 


Calculate the probability that the weekly screen time for thee sample is between 12 and 13 hours 
N(13.5, .375)
from 12 - 13 

normalcdf(lower=12, upper=13, m=13.5, o = .375)
= 0.0918
