# Discrete random variable
* A discrete random variable is a variable that has a fixed amount of possible numbers.
examples: shoe size ( you can be an 8 or an 8.5 but not an 8.34) or AP score.

# Expected value
* Mean

Standard deviation 2.22 
Interpret:
The wages typically vary by $ 2.22 from a mean of 9.50 $ 


Ms williamson would rather assign wages so that employees could get any amount from 10 - 20 $ and all are equally likely. 
This means that we are no longer dealing with discreet variables they are now continuous.

Home alone is a series of American Christmas family comedy films created by John Hughes. There are 5 Home Alone movies. Below is a probability distribution of the number of Home Alone movies wacthed by a very large sample of high school students

| Number of home alone movies watched | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3   | 4    | 5    |
| ---------------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | --- | ---- | ---- |
| Probability                        | 0.15 | 0.42 | 0.32 | ?   | 0.02 | 0.01 |

a. Write the event the student has seen 3 home alone movies using prbability notation. Then find this probability

P(X=3) = 0.08

Explain in words what P(x>=3) means. What is this probability? 

The probability of you having watched 3 or more home alone movies
P (X>=3) = 0.08+0.02+0.01 = 0.011

Caclulate and interprest the expected value of X
