^ these are things that I should be taught and should take notes on the teachings.  One of the many advantages of having a wonderful mother. 

Learn how works best for me to keep an organized room and organize stuff from projects ( e.g. what is to be done with all the stuff on my desk right now ? ) 

Learn to rely on proper cybersecurity practices such as : 
    Using a password manager that I selfhost 
    Using unique passwords 
    Isolating my identities from eachother, both through virtualization and through mental differentiation 

Learn to reflexively take notes on anything I will ever have to do in the future. E.g. just how to do laundry. Wish I took notes on that. Just open obsidian and write it down. Even just doing total recall after being taught it would be plenty good. Echo is also clutch for this.
