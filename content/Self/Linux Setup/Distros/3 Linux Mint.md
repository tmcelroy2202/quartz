Linux Mint is another good beginner distro. Ubuntu based. Shorter release cycle by far than zorin, so you can just sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade every once in a while and life will be good for you. There are also a ton more resources on linux mint than there are on zorin, with linux mint being much much more popular than zorin ever will be. It does not have a bunch of the cooler features of zorin ( windows app support, extensive theme customization with ease ) out of the box, but all of those things can be installed if you wish for them. 

Linux Mint is stable. It's still ubuntu based, so it has all the disadvantages of ubuntu, except snaps, it gets rid of snaps. It's pretty nice to use. I run it in some virtual machines to be servers for me when I do not want to think about using purely cli on a server.
