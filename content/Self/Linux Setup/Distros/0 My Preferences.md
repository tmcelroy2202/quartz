I love the idea behind NixOS but I am not good enough at using it yet that I can recommend it to anyone else or really put it high up in my preferences. I have one device that runs it ( thinkpad x220 ) and I do not currently plan to install it anywhere else. It needs a lot of time to learn. 

Really though, most of the time, distro choice does not matter. No matter what distro you choose, you can always swap in the features from another distro. Most of the time you SHOULDNT, but you totally can.
