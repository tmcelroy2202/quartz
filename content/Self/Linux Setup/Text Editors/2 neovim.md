Neovim builds upon [[3 vim]], providing a number of features that normal vim does not have. The main things people want from neovim are language servers and better plugins. There are a billion quadrillion million neovim plugins. Writing this I first wrote just "There are a billion neovim plugins" but then I was worried people would not understand it was hyperbole. There are a lot of neovim plugins. 

A number of them are really cool

Here are some examples of cool ones:
https://github.com/ggandor/leap.nvim
https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim
https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon
https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround
https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim
https://github.com/github/copilot.vim
https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim

If I had never tried helix, I would probably be using neovim right now, and honestly my life would probably be simpler. Neovim has direct integrations with ghosttext, and a billion other things, and I eventually probably will switch to it.
