VSCode is the default for most people.

It does a lot right.

The one thing it doesn't do right is helix bindings 

the helix plugins all suck 

oh also performance

its an electron app so it sucks back ram like crazy. 

I use it every once in a while, but its not an environment I would ever do actual development in. It is only ever used by me because its in the default repositories of most things and is easier to use the system clipboard with than vim.
