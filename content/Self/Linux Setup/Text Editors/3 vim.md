Vim is THE text editor. It is ubiquitous. It has been around for 500 years. It probably came installed by default on every single device you own ( other than windows devices ). It came installed by default on both my jailbroken iphone and my android phone. It of course ships with every single linux distro. vi ( vim stands for vi improved ) ships with macs. 

knowing vim means you can have a good experience editing text on any device ever. Whenever I remote into a server, I edit all config files with vim. Whenever I am on someone else's device and don't know what they have installed, I use vim. 

Vanilla vim is NOT a bad experience. It does not have some of the quality of life stuff I want from my main text editor, but it is certainly a better way of editing text than nano.
