Similar idea to vieb. Browser focused on vim based navigation. Just does not manage to implement the extensions the same way vieb does, and i have felt the UI to be much worse.

The way that qutebrowser goes about extensibility is purely through userscripts.
this is not an acceptable thing to me.

qutebrowser is cool, and much more well known than vieb, but imo just worse in every way than vieb, at accomplishing the same goal.
