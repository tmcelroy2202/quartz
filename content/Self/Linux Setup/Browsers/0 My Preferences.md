In order of quality of life:
1. Firefox
2. Vieb
3. Qutebrowser
4. Vivaldi
5. Chrome / Chromium 

I generally do not use anything else. 

Explanations for each of these are linked here:

[[1 Firefox]]

[[2 Vieb]]

[[3 Qutebrowser]]

[[4 Vivaldi]]

[[5 Chrome]]

Honorable mention: Mercury / Thorium

I tried mercury for a while and benchmarked it against firefox and saw no noticeable difference so i have not switched over.
