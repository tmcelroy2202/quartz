If i am going to use a normal non enthusiast browser, and it is going to be chromium based, I am just going to use google chrome. I am not interested in using Brave or Edge or anything like that for the rare times when I need a vanilla browser.

I keep chrome installed on my system, with only ublock origin installed, for whenever my firefox config breaks because I did something stupid, and yet i still need to go to a website, without time to fix it in the moment.
