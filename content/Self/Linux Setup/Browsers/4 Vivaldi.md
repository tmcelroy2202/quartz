Vivaldi allows me to get the setup I want ( mostly ), but it just takes 45 million years. So much garbage is turned on when you first install.

I spend the next 20 minutes ish each timei install vivaldi just changing settings. 

I can't even slim it down that much, because a lot of the stuff that I consider to be garbage is on a seperate bar with one item that I do actually need, so i can't just remove that bar. I can make it togglable with a keybind though., so that is what I do.

Vivaldi is a way better experience for me than chrome, but that is almost purely because it has options like " turn off tabs " which chrome does not have, and yet it can still install extensions from the chrome web store.
