I am writing this because my friends stress me out. Talking to them makes me notice how often they take risks that are entirely unnecessary and could blow back on them in a big way.

Please note, i'm not your mom. It's not that I don't want you to be doing bad things on the internet. You should just do whatever you are doing securely. You should not allow for your actions to ever lead to consequences. 

this is written very informally as it is addressed to friends.

Some core bullet points. You can click through on any one of these to see my explanation for WHY that is true: 
* [[1 Do not share your passwords. With anyone. Ever.]]
* [[2 Do not reuse passwords across different accounts]]
* [[3 If you wouldn't be comfortable with your mom and dad seeing it, don't send it.]]
* [[4 VPNS are not security]]
* [[5 Use an Adblocker]]
* [[6 Password managers are cool]]

If you do all these things:
* I will think you are cooler.
* I will want to talk about how you prefer to do those things.
* You will be less likely to be hacked in general.
* You will likely notice you have less drama relating to you.
