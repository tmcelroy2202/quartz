I do not care who it is. Your mom shouldn't have your passwords. Your boyfriend or girlfriend shouldn't have your passwords. Your best friend shouldn't have your passwords. I shouldn't have your passwords. I don't care if it's your actual wife and you are married, she shouldn't have your passwords. 

for the rest of this document whenever i refer to passwords i really mean just sensitive information / scenarios, including the following: 
* Your phone pin
* FaceID access to your phone
* Fingerprint access to your phone
* Your account passwords
* 2FA for your accounts 
* Your credit card info 
* The accounts themselves being logged in on another person's device

The entire purpose of a password, is to prove that it is YOU logging into the account. The person who owns the account. When you give another person a password, you are telling the service that they are you. They have all the same authority as you. If they wanna buy 300$ worth of vbucks on your apple pay, thats fine. If they wanna go through all your messages, cool! If they want to install malware on your device, a-ok! Whatever you have given them access to, is completely under their control. Please note, that for most of these scenarios, that person is a teenager. Teenagers are not known for their logical consistency and great decision making. 

Im gonna begin with boyfriends and girlfriends first, as that's the most common one i see:
* it is not unrealistic that at some point you break up. If you ever do break up, they can still login to your account, unless you remember to change the password, which you realistically will not do.
	* After breakups, people are often spiteful. 
		* What is the worst thing they could do out of spite to you with that account?
			* Post slurs as you? Post embarassing secrets you've told them ? Read through your DMs and post whatever they can find there ? 
* They should not really want your passwords.
	* Wanting your passwords ( usually ) implies a lack of trust. If there is a lack of trust, you two just ought not to be together. Simple as that. It will NOT work out. 
	* Even when wanting your passwords is just out of convenience ( e.g. you got a notification and he sees it and you are across the house, he wants to read it to you. ) , and not out of lack of trust, if they do not respect it when you don't give them the password, that is CONCERNING. 
		* Giving someone your password for convenience purposes also allows for them to just get curious and snoop through your phone. Bad Bad Not good.  No one should be holding your phone unlocked while you aren't in the room.

Now Best Friends:
* Do you ever argue ? 
	* Do you ever make rash decisions when you argue with eachother ?
		* Do you want a person who ever makes rash decisions to have access to your persona? I dont.
* Are they easily convinced?
	* Could you convince them of something that wasn't true?
		* Could another person? 
			* Could they be convinced that you did something evil ? 
				* How much harm could they do to you if they thought it was justified because they thought you were evil?
* Are you cool with all of their best friends being on your account. 
	* Example:
		* Jerry has a spotify account
		* Jim as at jerry's house
		* Jim asks jerry for the spotify login so he can play something on the tv
		* Jim has spotify himself so he doesn't need the login for him
		* Jim leaves jerry's house, but remembers the login ( or writes it down )
		* Jim's friend Jeff is talking to Jim a week later
		* "My spotify just ran out and school has been rouuuugh. I really cannot do biology in SILENCE i NEED MUSIC ive been on youtube with ads and its so baddddd "
		* Jim feels terrible for Jeff. He'd love to help Jeff. He has an idea. 
		* " Oh i've got jerry's spotify just use that "
		* " BRO TYSM "
		* " no problem "
		* Now jeff has jerry's spotify login. Jerry doesn't even know Jeff at all. 
		* jeff goes home to his family, and signs them all into Jerry's spotify.
		* Eventually Jerry gets kicked out of his own spotify because he is trying to play from too many devices at once ( this isnt how spotify works but just work with me here. it is how a lot of online services work ) ( You can only play one song and only play on one device at once with spotify )
		* Jerry has to now go through the spotify accounts website, find all the sessions that arent his, remove them, reset his password for spotify, delete all the playlists Jeff and his family made, and figure out how this happened in the first place. Jerry probably wont even remember he told Jim that login a week ago.
	* Do not think that this won't happen just because you told them " dont like share this with anyone " 

Now family members / your mom or your sister:
* Do you have instagram messages talking about you doing drugs?
	* If so, why would you want your mom to be able to theoretically access those? simple as that. that's just stupid. 
	* If not, what about IMessages? What about telegram messages with plugs ? 
* Do you have messages on your phone about you skipping school or sneaking out? 
* Do you have illicit photos on your phone ( nudes, porn, whatever else ) that you wouldn't want a parent or family member seeing? 
* If it's a brother or sister, your sibling is very very well connected to your mother.
	* Do you ever fight with your sister?
		* Do you make decisions your sister dissaproves of ? 
			* Would there ever be an incetive to snitch on you?
				* What about to get themselves out of trouble?
