Youtubers seem to often claim that a vpn somehow improves your cybersecurity.

It does not.

All a VPN does is put a server between you and your destination.
This increases latency, makes downloads slower, and if you are logging into an account on that service, you are still not anonymous.
a vpn DOES hide your ip, but there are plenty of other ways to identify you ( browser session, cookies, account logged in, etc )
public wifi is completely fine to use as long as all the websites you go to are using HTTPS ( they probably are ) ( Very few websites are still stuck on http. )
here is how you can tell if a website is http or https:
* Does it have the little lock icon at the top? 
* And does it say https:// before the website name ?

Here is a proper https website:

Here is a non https website:

See how the lock has an x through it and it doesnt say https:// ? 
that's how you tell.

Even on public wifi, there is very little hackers can do to you, as long as you are using https to access websites. They can read the domains you are going through ( unless you use dns over https ), but they can't read what you're doing on those domains. It is not realistically a problem that they can see what domains you are going to.
