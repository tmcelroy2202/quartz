I recommend ublock origin : 
![chrome webstore]( https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm )
![firefox addon store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)

You can get it on android via firefox mobile or kiwi browser.

The reason this is crucial for cybersecurity is ads are the main way people get malware. You click an ad for hot singles in your area, you hit allow by accident for notifications on that website, and now you get spam from hotsingles.ru every day, and you can't be asked to fix it so you get tommy to do it. 

If you had an adblocker, it wouldn't have allowed you to go to hotsingles.ru at all. It also wouldn't have shown you the hot singles ad in the first place. 

Adblockers are also great for quality of life, and can make the internet work faster ( not having to render ads means you save a whole ton of bandwidth which can be used for whatever else you are doing )
