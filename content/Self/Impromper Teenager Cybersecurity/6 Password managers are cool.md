I recommend bitwarden: https://bitwarden.com/
or 1password: https://1password.com/
or if you are willing to selfhost: https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden

Using a password manager means you don't have to remember your passwords. It is a nice world to live in. Setting it up the first time is a little annoying, but once you get it going, you can be much more secure, and your life can be much more convenient.

Currently you remember atleast a few different identities:
	Canvas login
	Classlink login
	Instagram login
	Apple login
	etc

You can remember only 1:
	password manager login

and even that, you usually wont have to enter the password for, you can just have it use faceid. 

this also means that you can now have much better passwords for canvas and classlink and instagram and such because you dont have to actually remember them. Your password for instagram could be 29Am30MSMS!894nA#11,./A> right now, and it wouldn't be a problem, because your password manager handles it. 

All a password manager does is store all your passwords, encrypt them, and autofill them. Good password managers ( like bitwarden and 1password ) are audited by security researchers very often, and won't be a security risk. Whenever you login to a website, they will prompt you to save that login, and then if you do, next time you are at the login page for that website, they will ask if you want them to autofill your password. You can make them autofill always by default if you wanna, but i dont.
