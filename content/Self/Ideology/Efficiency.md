Why would you do anything in any way other than the most efficient way possible?
Why would I want to waste time doing something that could be done better ? Why would I not wish to reach the most efficient way possible to do that thing? 

Before I do just about anything, I spend a decent amount of time planning best practices for it. This allows me to start with a strong foundation beforehand, and then build a good system for going about that thing in the future at a much faster rate than normal. I can avoid building bad habits which get the job done, just by focusing heavily on efficiency.
