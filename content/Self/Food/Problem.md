I eat awful food, and TONS of it. 
It's also not even cheap.

Now that I have a job, I have to bring food to that job for lunch, and I am in a situation where it makes sense for me to start trying to automate things. 

Currently, the food I bring is stuff like frozen Mac and Cheese. 
This is not a viable solution. it is not cheap, it is not healthy it is not going to stay enjoyable, its just not worth keeping up. 

I also am unwilling to cook before work though. There is no way that I will have the time or energy. Im currently waking up at 4AM on days where I have to get to work at 6AM, and the time works out just perfectly with microwaving a meal. There is no shot I could wake up earlier and get more done. It's just not happening. The night before, im also usually too wiped out or busy with other stuff to add something major like that to my docket. 

ok, so quick summary of whats wrong:
* I dont have a good system for bringing food to work
* frozen mac and cheese is too expensive and too unhealthy 
* I do not have time to homecook meals immediately before work or the night before work. 

# Solution
Meal prep!

Optimally, here is the situation:

Every friday, or saturday, I do the following: 
* make 7 days worth of food which is:
	* Cheap
	* Healthy
	* Easy to make
* store it all in a way which will allow it to stay good for the next 7 days
* know which days i eat which thing, so I can eat the stuff that goes bad the quickest first. 
* have an intuitive system to grab the things and put them into a bag, in the right order. 

Here are the options im considering:
* Chicken Burritos
	* Tortilla
	* Chicken strips or diced chicken
	* Rice
	* Cheese
* Beef Burritos
	* Tortilla
	* Beef
	* Black Beans
	* Cheese
* Bowls with the same stuff
* Quesadillas with the same stuff
* Marie Calendars Beef Chili
* Baked Ziti ( not healthy, but possible, and diverse. Don't know if it can be done cheap and easy. )

Along with all these things, I would include, Strawberries, and brocolli, or some other combination of fruits and vegetables

This requires shopping for plastic containers for these things though, so I can store them, sealed, in a freezer. 

Container shopping:
* https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QS9R3Q9/ref=cm_sw_r_apa_i_SZN6GN2RCS8XG19HZJDQ_0?_encoding=UTF8&th=1 ( 12 pack, 36$, )
* https://www.amazon.com/HOMBERKING-Containers-Compartment-Airtight-BPA-Free/dp/B0C5HRQ1BQ/ ( 10 pack, 35$, bigger, have organizer divider)
* https://www.amazon.com/Ezalia-Containers-Leakproof-Microwave-Dishwasher/dp/B0BR187DCJ/ ( 50 pack, 20.49$, seem pretty big, dishwasher and microwave safe, look stackable for storage when not in use. I do not need 50 though. Also dont have a ton of faith in that seal when in my bike bag.  )
* https://www.amazon.com/PrepNaturals-Glass-Storage-Containers-Multi-Compartment/dp/B081JRZ8W6/ ( 8 pack, for 40$, glass, 36oz )


I also need the actual materials  to make the food:
Tortilla:

* https://www.amazon.com/Mission-Burrito-Flour-Tortillas-Authentic/dp/B0019FJGN2/ ( 10 in, 8 count for 3.79$)
* https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Large-Burrito-Flour-Tortillas-8-Count/250773760?wl13=1464&selectedSellerId=0&wmlspartner=wlpa ( dont see size, but its an 8 count for 2.08$, )

I think ill probably live. 22 cents per burrito. ) ( THIS IS SAMS CLUB AND I DO NOT KNOW IF WE HAVE A MEMBERSHIP. If we do, then its super cheap and worth buying, but like, why do we have a sams club membership ?? if we dont, then its not worth paying for a sams club membership.)
