In the event of a power outage, we have a number of power banks that I keep charged at all times. 

I use these power banks to charge up my phone and airpods so that I can go through my day normally, and then recharge these powerbanks at school or work or wherever else I go during the day. 

This does mean I lose my selfhosted services during the day when we have power outages. This is of course, problematic for me. 

I would like to avoid this. 

I would like to get a minipc, with low enough power draw to be comfortably ran off of a power bank for an extended time period. Like, around 24 hours would be optimal, but I would take 12. 

The main thing people like for this is an n100. I am also somewhat interested in raspberry pi 5, or other, similar SBC. 

Regardless, I would be using an nvme drive for storage.

Here's what I would like to run:
1. zapret ( dpi evasion )
2. wifi hotspot routed through zapret
3. my notes server ( I would update cloudflare to point to it instead of the normal server )
4. my music server ( It would have all the music synced over already, and, I would, again, just update cloudflare to point to it instead of the normal server )
5. my password manager  ( would be restored from a recent vault export )
