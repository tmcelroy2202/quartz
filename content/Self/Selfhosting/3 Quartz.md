Quartz as a whole has been pretty nice to work with. I have no gripes with a majority of how it has worked. A few things could have been a little more obvious.

Quartz is an alternative to Obsidian Publish which allows for me to selfhost a web ui which lets anyone look at my notes. Im hosting my instance of quartz publicly [here](https://notes.tommyhost.ing) and [here](notes.gamingjones.gay). 

setting this document up is a pain because i cant copy from cloudflare's browser vnc into my kasm container so i am probably not gonna do it for a while
