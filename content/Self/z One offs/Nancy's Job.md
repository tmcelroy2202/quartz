Quickbooks ( become familiar with and organize ) - no clue

Online banking ( become familiar with and organize ) - seems simple

the following: 

	Payroll 
	
	cd's ( organize schedule )
	
	Budget ( help us determine an operating budget )

Can all be greatly helped by:
https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/
and 
logging EVERYTHING YOU HEAR and EVERYTHING YOU DO with 
https://obsidian.md/ or your preferred note taking system.
strongly recommend online notes because of the ability to link them to eachother


This whole thing:

	Become familiar with the 4 chapel properties from a business side and help us organize what the business needs of each of these properties are 
	
	Potential needs :
	
		1. Organize proof of ownership papers; site plans; etc. 
		
		2. Check into the insurance situation on the properties 
		
		3. Check into the tax status / state / county / town requirements for the properties 
		
		4. Look into other ways of protecting our investments 


In large part would be helped by a document scan and search solution like paperless ngx, and a note taking system with obsidian. having access to it across all your devices would be of great help for organizing things. 

I would make a folder for insurance and put all documents related to insurance into that folder. 
I would make a folder for tax requirements and put all documents related to tax requirements into that folder
I would make a folder for proof of ownership papers, and a folder for site plans, and a folder for any other major things, then put all documents for them in there. 

You can put this obsidian vault onto a flash drive if you dont want to cloud sync it to anywhere because of how sensitive the documents are, and you can back up that flashdrive manually if you wish, but really if i was doing this i would use syncthing to back up all my documents across devices:  https://syncthing.net/

For these things:

	Become familiar with the particular structure and organization of Our Lady of Fatima Chapel with regard to the members of the chapel ( through reading the Chapel's bylaws ). 
	
	1. Create a database ( they said datebase which is hilarious ) of the chapel members ( name / address / phone / email etc )
	
	2. create a database for the "Voting Members" of the chapel ( members of 3 years or more. ) 

For your database of chapel members, have a look at : https://www.breezechms.com/all-features

That can also be your voting members via their groups feature https://www.breezechms.com/product/groups 

so you could just group the normal members into the voting members. 

	Other related tasks : 
	
	1. Organize the office computer:
	
		1. Business files
		
		2. Pastoral files

Organizing the office computer - Assuming the office computer is running windows, there are a few things you should install. 
1. Malwarebytes ( Antivirus, as im imagining the church is probably not the greatest at computer literacy ) (https://www.malwarebytes.com/)
2. Wiztree ( if you need more drive space on it, wiztree will analyze the drive and show you all the biggest files. DO NOT DELETE OR MOVE ANYTHING YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND. DO NOT DELETE PAGEFILES OR CORE WINDOWS COMPONENTS. You should though look through whats taking up space on the drive though, if you are at close to drive capacity. ) ( https://www.diskanalyzer.com/ )
3. Everything ( Lets you search all files across the whole computer ( file names ) this means that you do not have to know their folder structure to find important files in in an instant )  ( https://www.voidtools.com/downloads/ )
4. If you do not have the office suite initially, have a look at https://www.libreoffice.org/ or https://www.onlyoffice.com/

for these:

	2. Organize chapel office space
	
		1. Filing cabinets
		
		2. Chapel records

Scan each document into paperless ngx if you can. 
For paperless ngx you will need a server. 
i strongly recommend you get a little mini pc for that server if tight on cash for server budget - Confirm with me before you choose anything to purchase there. Ebay is where you would go, and you would buy a thinkcentre or a hp mini pc or a nuc. 

For these:

	3. Organize chapel vendors
	
		1. Create database of who our vendors / contractors are ( liturgical supplies / plubming / insurance agent, etc )
		
		2. passwords / account information
		
		3. automatic billing 
		
		4. Inquire about discounts / other alternatives

Database of who our vendors / contractors are - can be done in your notes app, or even could be done in breeze chms. Really though breeze should be for church members in my brain, so i would put the vendors list in your notes. Each vendor would have a document with all relevant info about them and they would be under a folder called vendors. You could also do a excel spreadsheet for this, or a real database for this, i guess, but i dont imagine it is a large enough list to warrant that. 

Passwords / account information - SET UP A PASSWORD MANAGER.
DO NOT STORE YOUR PASSWORDS IN PLAIN TEXT ANYWHERE. DO NOT ALLOW FOR THEM TO STORE PASSWORDS ON STICKY NOTES EITHER. PASSWORDS SHOULD NOT BE ANYWHERE OTHER THAN A SAFE OR A SECURE PASSWORD MANAGER.

If you want to selfhost your password manager, use vaultwarden https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden
Vaultwarden is fully free and open source software, so you can indeed trust that they arent doing anything with your passwords. It would run on a server you own ( preferably that thinkcentre ) 

if you do not want to selfhost your password manager, use normal bitwarden https://bitwarden.com/

Vaultwarden interfaces with the normal bitwarden apps. 

IF YOU ARE USING THE SAME PASSWORDS FOR ANY DIFFERENT SERVICES, CHANGE THAT. REAL BUSINESSES CANNOT DO THAT. 

For these:

	4. Establish a business schedule 	
	
		1. Tasks to be done on a quarterly, half-a-year, yearly-basis	
		
		2. Incorporate that into our chapel schedule

Notes would be fine, dictating what you need done on a quarterly, half a year, and yearly basis. You would just then share these notes to someone, through some secure channel. these would not be publicly posted preferably. 

I have no clue what incorporate that into our chapel schedule means. 

For these:

5. Work with Mr. McNeely concerning the relationship with the chapel and FSSP North America / Diocese of paterson 

	1. Sacramental records
	
	2. Safe environment records
	
	3. Understanding what they expect from us from a business / records standpoint

again: organizing records, should be done through paperless and obsidian. This is my view. 

Dont know what "understanding what they expect from us from a business / records standpoint" entails. 

6. Help us Work towards our future goals

	1. Fundraising ideas
	
	2. Property assessments
	
	3. Good relationships with town / state / diocese, etc.
	
	4. Helping make the school more secure 

these arent techy goals and so i dont have input.
