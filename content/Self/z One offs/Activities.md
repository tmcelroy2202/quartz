This is just a list of activities i want people to do 

In no way am i saying these things are **good group activities**, i am merely saying i want people to do them.

1. Watch Community ( Funny! )
2. Watch From ( Very Engaging! )
3. Laser Tag!
4. Tell Tommy about Tech Problems and have Tommy improve your quality of life ( mostly an individual thing ). Quick list of examples of tech problems you likely have but possibly do not know you have:
	1. I am paying for a streaming service ( spotify, netflix, etc ) and it would be cool to save money and have that for free 
	2. My computer is getting slow and I "need a new one" ( you probably do not, I can probably fix what's wrong with your computer for much cheaper ) ( it is probably just your hard drive dying ) ( if you do need a new one ill have strong opinions on how to shop for a new one )
	3. School wifi blocks stuff for me and it is annoying
	4. My teachers take my phone in my classes and it is annoying 
5. Complete some kind of project as a group. Just something we all want to get done. I would love to have like productive hangouts. Here are some examples of when this would be applicable:
	1. Sara wanted to build herself a massive snowglobe for storage and display of miniaturized versions of her books. I had many ideas about how she could do lighting of those and how she could suspend them in some kind of liquid, etc. We did a hangout, we went to michaels and target and shopped around, we found some good materials, we drew up plans, etc. That did eventually fall through, but I enjoyed that hangout greatly. I like having a goal. 
	2. Lucas and Byron's brewing
	3. Studying focused hangouts 
6. Create a study group for a class we all have. We do not have to all have the same teacher, or same block, we just have to have a class in the same semester and be able to meet up at some set times to study as a group. Would be purely study focused. Like from community!!!

I would also love to have more individual hangouts with people. Those are always my favorite. Groups are good too, but they are nowhere near as nice as a one on one interaction with a person ever. I would rather have a 2 hour hangout with someone I am just ok with individually than have a 4 hour hangout with a group of people who i love.
