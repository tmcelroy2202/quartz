I do not wear any clothing with logos on it.
This is really how I have always been. I do not see a reason for me to be a walking adidas ad. I do not care about adidas, I do not endorse any of their missions, why would I walk around spreading their brand recognition??? 

For a majority of my life, this has meant I only shop at target, all my clothing is from goodfellow ( target's in house clothing brand ), because it has absolutely no branding. Just solid colors. It's the safest route. It does not endorse absolutely anything, it does not mean anything, it will not spark any conversations, I will never be asked to "name 3 songs", etc. 

I do HAVE interests though, and shopping for exclusively bland clothing is a little tedious. Stores dont actually sell that much bland clothing. You have to shop for it special. I do have groups with missions that I do wish to succeed, and I do believe in, but my concern is that i will cringe so hard if i walk outdoors wearing a free and libre open source software shirt. I need it to be very understated. I need it to be understated enough that if you did not know what it was, then you wouldn't question it, and if I was asked about it and didn't want to explain it, I could just say " oh i dont know its my brothers ". 

Here are my criteria:
* No huge designs in the middle of the shirt
* Designs should go in the top left if possible 
* Any design needs to be generic enough that you can't google it or wouldn't google it
	* This means nothing that explicitly states it's message. 
* Shirt should be comfortable
* Shirt should be a color I would wear ( when am I gonna wear a black t shirt??? ) 

I cannot imagine any of the groups i like making remotely fashionable clothing, but really I don't need fashionable, I just need generic. None of my current clothing is fashionable. 

options:
* nixos merch - https://www.redbubble.com/people/mogorman/shop
	* i would want to have actually switched to nixos before buying any of this, but the shirt is also just ugly ( it is because of the quokka ) ( maybe next release will have a better animal ) 
* freewear - http://freewear.org/
	* interpeer "there is no ethical telemetry under capitalism" - https://www.freewear.org/FW0681--Interpeer-Project-Ethical-T-shirt 
	* interpeer " any sufficiently useful telemetry is indistinguishable from privacy invasion " - https://www.freewear.org/FW0682--Interpeer-Project-Privacy-T-shirt
		* both of those interpeer shirts are very ugly looking atleast on the website.
	* vim - https://www.freewear.org/FW0369--Forest-Vim-T-shirt
	* vim - https://www.freewear.org/FW0260--Vim-Dark-T-shirt 
* hellotux - https://www.hellotux.com
	* arch shirt - https://www.hellotux.com/arch_2_tshirt_darkblue 
	* copyleft shirt - https://www.hellotux.com/copyleft_tshirt_darkblue 

a lot of those are very ugly and i would not wear, but they are some of the best i can find. linux users are not known for their fashionability. mostly known for their smell. 

I might also just need fashion advice in general.
