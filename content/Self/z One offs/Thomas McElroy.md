### Operating System Knowledge 
* Was a windows power user for around 5 years. Created an environment I enjoyed --  using FancyWM as my tiling window manager, and yasb as my status bar. Am aware of and have used most windows power user tools. For example: powertoys, sysinternals utilities, the registry, etc. 
* Am currently running Linux on most of my devices, and am very comfortable navigating a terminal, and using GNU Coreutils. Am also knowledgeable on many of the nicher Linux distros, having spent lots of time on Arch, and having recently migrated one of my main devices to NixOS.
* My Main phone is a Rooted Google Pixel 6. I would consider myself a power user on Android as well. I know how to do just about anything a person could realistically want to do on Android.
* I also have an iPhone 13, which is jailbroken, on iOS 16.2, using Dopamine. It is not as enjoyable an experience for me, but I used it as my main phone for multiple years. I am aware of a grand majority of Apple features, and will be able to help people with iOS or iPadOS devices just fine.
