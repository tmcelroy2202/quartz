Currently using obsidian, with the excalidraw plugin to draw things that require drawing, git for backups,  quartz for exposing it, and syncthing for syncing it across devices.

I do not like this, because obsidian is not open source. it is not libre. it is a core part of my life and it is proprietary. I hate that. It also is electron. I hate that aswell.

Other options:

Helix:
* love the binds
* is the editor im most comfortable with
* extremely performant
* terminal based exclusively
* cannot do inline images at all. i would be taking notes with likely 0 images, unless i was manually typing out their links, and pulling up a reference document on the side via the markdown lsp. 
* markdown lsp might actually be the move. helix is easily the most compelling to me of these options. The vim bindings are nice but they are no helix. they have too many button presses and dont feel fluid enough, which helix does. i dont think this is an objective helix feels better or is less button presses, its just personal preference. im also much more confident with it which is nice. it also has native multi cursor which is nice. i love helix. 

Qownnotes:
* can use scribble for drawing
* native image support
* vim mode 
* lighter than obsidian 
* native integration with owncloud and nextcloud, which would mean i could probably not have to use syncthing, which would be cool. 
* i hate it. i tried it and i just do not like it. it doesnt have any highlighting for bulleted lists in the editor, and its just not a compelling enough change for me to do it. i would have to get a setup for editing excalidraw files and exporting them to svgs myself and pasting them that i could do QUICKLY for usage in class too. just dont like it. 


Emacs:
* Can do inline images in gui mode
* has a terminal version too
* very cool editor
* heavy
* https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs
* https://github.com/wdavew/org-excalidraw
	* this is hacky and weird, but seems to work
* has been around for 50 years - is kinda the standard for this stuff. 

zim: 
* basic
* native image support because its gui
* Nothing about it really sticks out to me. it is *just* a markdown editor, and I mean that in a negative way. Just a markdown editor is what a lot of people want, but not what I want. What I want is a well optimized note taking program.

neovim:
* light
* terminal based, but with image support for terminals with image support
* https://github.com/jbyuki/venn.nvim
* no excalidraw support and I dont see a way to get any, other than to roll my own. 

# Review
I thought Qownnotes was gonna be nice. I wanted qownnotes to be nice. I just did not like it at all. super cool project, glad it exists, but not for me.

Emacs seems like it could do what I want. It has the ability to do images, but im not locked into a gui, it has an excalidraw integration, it has the community support to do anything else I ever could want to do. But it's consistently reviewed as "heavy".
