this would allow me to do the led light above system one first, which would be nice, but then also do the cleaner system after  I think. I would make a mount that attached to the front of each container and do a LED diffusion panel on the front. until I could do that though, I could totally do the LED strips on top of each row or below each row to show the current index with this organizre, as the rows have pronounced enough lines inbetween.

this one has more containers, so would likely be more work, but i could store more stuff. 
looks like it has a mostly open back

which would make my life easier for the cable routing portion.

big enough bottom things for storage of a decent amount of stuff, and tons of top drawers

problem is the bottom things are not big enough for storage of larger items like laptops. I think I want to use my existing organizer for that.
