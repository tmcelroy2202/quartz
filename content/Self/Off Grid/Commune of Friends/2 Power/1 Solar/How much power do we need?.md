How much power we need varies *greatly* depending on what we want to power. 


## What i think we need
* Heat in winter months and AC in summer months
* Server for selfhosting services  ( could be done off an SBC for everything other than video transcoding )
* Light in the form of lamps and such in all homes
* power for fans 
* Ability to power a few laptops ( for people using them, not for hosting services ) ( laptops are the most power hungry devices anyone is liable to be using off grid )

So here is my worst case scenario:
* 30 degrees out, heat set to 75 inside of building
	* depends on heating solution
		- **Central Heating Furnace:** 340 watts
		- **Portable Electric Fan Heater:** 2,000 to 3,000 watts
		- **Central Air Conditioner:** 1,000 to 4,000 watts
		- **Window AC Unit:** 900 to 1,440 watts
* server transcoding video, pulling back 100w
* lets say 10 LED lamps are on ( 10w each, 10 * 10 = 100w)
* No fans are on because we are running heat
* we have 3 laptops on, all charging, and sucking back 100w.

total:
340 ( assuming central heating furnace ) + 100 + 100 + 300 = 840
