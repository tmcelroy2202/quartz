I do not see how the economy will continue to work indefinitely. I am seeing massive improvements in AI and I am having trouble imagining any job which it would be unreasonable to believe AI could eventually do. I talk more about this here: [[The Problem]]

If the Economy does collapse, because no one has jobs anymore, and so no one makes money anymore, then living off grid would mean that the collapse of the economy would not matter to me. I would be completely unaffected.

There are also privacy reasons to want to live ( relatively ) off grid. There is no way to anonymously buy a house. There is no way to anonymously have a credit card. There is no way to anonymously buy an apartment. Each time you do any of those things though, your info is sold to data brokers. There are ways to fight this through [Incogni](https://incogni.com/) or [DeleteMe](https://www.deleteme.com/) , but they are only making *kind requests* to remove your data, not stopping the collection of it in the first place. They also cannot *force* anyone to remove your data, so really, once they have your data, you can't be sure they've gotten rid of it.

Here is what I would want from Off Grid life:
* No Subscription services / recurring expenses 
	* Buying things one off is fine, but paying anything recurring isnt sustainable if I go fully off grid, as making money cannot be done fully off grid. 
* To have life anonymized as much as possible / to escape corporate tracking
	* This means that buying land in my own name would suck. ( who owns what land is public record. ). Would much rather someone else own the land and i merely live on it. Could be done with or without their knowledge ( wendys vs commune )
* To still keep most of the modern luxuries I have. You would think you would need the grid for this, but you wouldn't, atleast you would not need a constant connection to it.
