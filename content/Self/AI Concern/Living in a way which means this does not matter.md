You can live off grid enough that this wouldn't matter to you

Power can be gotten through solar
Solar links:

Infrastructure that can be self-hosted:
	Music:
		Navidrome and slskd 
	Messaging:
		Matrix
		LoRa
	Cloud:
		Nextcloud
	Movies and TV
		Jellyfin + arr stack


Devices that can selfhost that stuff for cheap and with low power usage:
	Raspberry pi 5
	Raspberry pi 4
	Raspberry pi zero 2 w 
	Just about any single board computer

Food options:

Legitimately start a farm. ( fully off grid but lots of work ) 

buy huge amounts of canned food beforehand ( bad solution )  

live off wendys rewards abuse ( 1.80$ per meal )  ( 167 a month ) ( 2000 / year ) (terrible solution, but an entirely mobile one which doesnt rely on the availability of much of anything)

living situation options: 

Could just buy some land for cheap and build something on it :

would be an insane amount of work and expensive, but once you've done it you're good.
especially in a small town like all of those are. 

Could buy one of those amazon rivian electric vans and live in it, sucking power and wifi off a business
