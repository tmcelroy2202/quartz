All of my notes are within my quartz content folder 
Each Semester has a folder, for all my 4x4 classes from that semester.
A day B day classes also have their own seperate folders
Each year I make a fresh new vault, to avoid clogging things up.

Within each Semester, I have a folder for each class.
Within each class, I have a folder for each unit,  preferably starting with the unit number, like "7 Unit" or "8 Unit", so that I can easily navigate to them purely by keyboard in the file manager. If you do not need to navigate purely by keyboard, then this is not relevant to you, and you can name them whatever you want. 
Within each unit I start each note name with a number so that alphabetically sorting them makes them be in the right order. For APCSA I then also said which unit it was, and then which codehs segment matched up with it, so for example:


1 4 - 1 While Loops 

or

3 6 - 3 Enhanced for loop

This allows for my notes to organize themselves, so that when i need to insert something else in, i easily can. I can also pin things to the end of a folder by beginning a note's name with z, so for example, z99 review, is something i do a lot for chemistry. 

I know that looks redundant, the unit is already in the unit folder, and the item should already be that first number, but it is what makes sense to me mentally, and also, sometimes the item doesn match up, for example:

[[6 7 - 6 Selection Sort]]

[[7 7 - 6.2 Insertion Sort]]

I am not doing anything fancier than this. it is easy to get sucked into spending more time organizing notes fancily than actually writing notes, and I would rather avoid that, because im totally susceptible, i mean look at my setup.
