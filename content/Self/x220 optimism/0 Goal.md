I would like for this laptop to run exclusively free and libre open source software.
Exclusively.

I would like to avoid using google products on the laptop of any kind, which means i must find away around google docs ( which is required for school ). I would like to use kasm workspaces when it will be necessary for me to use a google doc. 


I would like to have as much as possible that runs on it be native and lightweight. I would like for things to be as resource efficient as possible.

this means that switching to tui programs to replace google products or electron apps would be optimal
