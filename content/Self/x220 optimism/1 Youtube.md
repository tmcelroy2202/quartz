# minitube 

no download video button, which is weird. 
dont love that its a gui and its not absolutely gorgeous 
also dont love that its ripping through 316mb at the homepage.
ui seems clunky, and overall, im just not a huge fan. 

# freetube
electron
has a download button, change media formats button, and local playlists
did not see anything interesting about it 
using 294 + 221 + 146 + 78 + 62 = 801mb of ram across all its processes ( yuck ) 

# tartube
less of a youtube browsing client and more of a youtube file manager

# headset
wants a youtube api key, nope.

# ytfzf
uses invidious as a backend
terminal based
uses my default player to play the video
awesome ux ( fzf to search for which video i want after i search? genius. )
posix shell script ( will likely be easy to play with if needed!! )
i like this 
i want to figure out a different player than mpv though, or atleast some other settings for mpv, because i would love a faststream like interface in my player

# invidious-cli
not in nixpkgs so i would need to download and put in my dotfiles, and i think thats not necessary, as ytfzf seems to work great. 

# yewtube
cli youtube streamer
uses my default player
seems to be trying to do same thing as ytfzf but worse 

# smtube 
installation failed on my first try and i just didnt look into it further


i did try:

youtube-tui
pipe-viewer


and i liked them, they were easily the best out of the other options. i just stopped wanting to write these reviews when i realized how good ytfzf is.
