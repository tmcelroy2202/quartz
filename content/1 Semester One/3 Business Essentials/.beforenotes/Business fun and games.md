Financial analysis - get lean for expansion - look at all the spending the business is currently doing and decide whether things could be done for cheaper, whether things are necessary as a whole, or if things need more money in order to increase in quality. 

Marketing - Take out ads and billboards so that people will come and bowl - preferably in the immediate area, and the ads should target the demographics the business is interested in 

Human Resources Management - Establish a corporate HR sector so that when future branches are added we do not have problems with things like disputes between employees leading to lawsuits, also start training employees to work in the bowling section.

Operations - Begin construction of the bowling area

Information Management - Store all information related to the bowling addition project and the annexing new chapters project in a centralized repository with access strictly controlled, and with version control, so that no one can wipe out your storage. Keep backups.

Strategic Management - Oversee each sector of the business and make sure no one is slacking and make sure no one is unnecessary to reaching the business's goals.
