A. Discuss the value of following ethical principles consistently.  
Choose an ethical person you admire. This could be someone you know (such as a parent,  
friend, or teacher) or someone you don’t know (such as a historical figure, politician, athlete, or celebrity).  
1. Describe at least one action this person has taken to display ethical behavior.  
2. What makes this person ethical, and which ethical principles does s/he demonstrate?  
3. How does this person consistently display ethics in their life? Be prepared to share your  
work.

An ethical person i admire is my mom. My mom runs a soup kitchen, which helps the homeless have a healthy meal. She shows integrity, responsibility, and accountability. She will often not go to a restaurant because they make unethical decisions, and she seems like she tries to make the best choices morally at all times.

B. Describe consequences of acting unethically.  
Throughout history, we have seen people attempt to bend ethics, lie, cheat, and steal to get  
ahead. Oftentimes, these individuals are caught, and their actions brought to light. Students  
should research a business individual who has had questionable ethics in the last 25 years.  
1. Who is the person?  
2. What did they do that was ethically questionable?  
3. What were the consequences of their action?  
CANCELED do not write - 4. They should then write a one-page summary of this information to be turned in.

Sam Bankman Fried is the Unethical person that i am choosing. He created a crypto currency and based a banking system off of it, and had his wife ( who is the head of Alameda Research ) base large portions of Alameda's net worth off of this cryptocurrency, and let her do insider trading off of information he knew about the cryptocurrency. He is looking at up to ten years in jail.

  
C. Ethics Case (Ethical Principles Involved: Integrity, Transparency, Fairness, Respect)  
Ashlyn and her team just finished presenting to the board of directors, and it went extremely  
well! After the presentation, one of the directors approached Ashlyn and told her that she did an excellent job. He told her that because of her hard work, he was going to recommend her for a promotion. Ashlyn was excited and proud, but she also felt guilty. The presentation was successful because of her whole team, not just her individual efforts.  
1. What should Ashlyn do?  
2. Should she accept the praise and what comes with it? Or should she make sure to give  
credit to her teammates, even if it costs her a promotion?

She should say something like " Well it's a team effort!" or "I could not have done it without my teammates! ". 

She should definitely give credit to the teammates even if it costs a promotion, but if giving credit does not cost the promotion ( which i kinda doubt that it would ), she should take the promotion.
