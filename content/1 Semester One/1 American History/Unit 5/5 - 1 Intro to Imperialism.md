Introduction to Imperialism

_ESSENTIAL QUESTION_
* How can a desire for increased global trade impact the distribution of power and the authority of industrialized countries 

SO...WHAT IS IMPERIALISM?
* Imperialism - the policy in which stronger nations extend their economic, political, or military control over weaker territories 
* BUT WHY?
    * Desire for military strength
    * Thirst for new markets
    * Belief in cultural superiority

Desire for Military Strength
* Admiral Alfred T. Mahan of the U.S. Navy urged government officials to build up American naval power in order to compete with other powerful nations.
    * United States built nin steel-hulled cruisers between 1883 and 1890 
* Early 1900s - the US " Great White Fleet " sails around the world to show off the third largest naval fleet in the world 

Thirst for New Markets
* The United States needed raw materials for its factories and new markets for its agricultural and manufactured goods.
* Imperialists felt that a worldwide trade network anchored by US colonies / territories and trading posts could provide the country with the economic growth it needed

Belief in Cultural Superiority
* Some Americans combined the philosophy of Social Darwinism—a belief that free-market competition would lead to the survival of the fittest—with a belief in the racial superiority of Anglo-Saxons.
* They argued that the United States had a responsibility to spread Christianity and democracy to "civilize" the world's "inferior people "

Seward’s Folly - Acquiring Alaska
* In 1867, Secretary of State William Seward arranged for the United States to buy Alaska from the Russians for $7.2 million.
    * Some poeple thought it was silly to buy what they called "Seward's Icebox " or "Seward's folly"
* In 1959 - Alaska becomes the 49th state in the Union
    * For about two cents an acre, the United States had acquired a land rich in timber, minerals, and as it turned out, oil.

The Importance of Hawaii
* The Hawaiian Islands had been economically important to the United States for nearly a century.
    * Halfway point to Asia - Important for Fueling.
    * Pearl Harbor - American Naval Headquarters in the Pacific
    * Tropical Climate - American Planters move to grow sugar cane and make money!
*  Then the McKinley Tariff of 1890 provoked a crisis by eliminating the duty-free status of Hawaiian sugar.
    * American planters in Hawaii called for the United States to annex the islands so they wouldn't have to pay the duty

Overthrowing a Monarch
* In 1891, Queen Liliuokalani came to power with a “Hawaii for Hawaiians” agenda.
    * She proposed removing the property-owning qualifications for voting
* To prevent this from happening, business groups -- with the help of marines -- overthrew the queen and set up a government headed by Sanford B Dole.
* On August 12, 1898, Congress proclaimed Hawaii an American territory
    * Hawaii becomes a state in 1959

Anti-Imperialism Emerges
* Anti-Imperialist League -  included some of the most prominent people in America, such as former president Grover Cleveland, industrial leader Andrew Carnegie, labor leader Samuel Gompers, and social worker Jane Addams.
* Concerns included the impact of imperialism on American Labor, foreign relationships with European Powers, and the concern of the United States to rule other people without their consent
