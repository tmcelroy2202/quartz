The Civil Rights Movement part 2

Sit Ins

* On February 1, 1960, four African American college students from north Carolina A&T University began protesting racial segregation in restaurants by sitting at "White Only" lunch counters and waiting to be served.

Desegregating Southern University

* In 1962, James Meredith—an African American—applied for admission to the University of Mississippi. 
* The university attempted to block Meredith's admission, and he flied suit.
* After working through the state courts, Meredith was successful when a federal court ordered the university to desegregate and accept Meredith as a student.
* The Governor of Mississippi, Ross Barnett, defied the court order and tried to prevent Meredith from enrolling.
* In response, President Kennedy intervened to uphold the court order. Kennedy sent federal troops to protect Meredith when he went to enroll.
* During his first night on campus, a riot broke out when whites began to harass the federal marshals.
* In 1963, the governor of Alabama, George C. Wallace, threatened a similar stand, trying to block the desegregation of the University of Alabama. The Kennedy administration responded with the full power of the federal government, including the U.S. Army.
* The confrontations with Barnett and Wallace pushed President Kennedy into a full commitment to end segregation
* In June 1963, Kennedy proposed civil rights legislation

The March on Washington

* Martin Luther King, JR. delivered a moving address to an audience of more than 200,000 people. 
* His "I Have a Dream" speech -- delivered in front of the giant statue of Abraham Lincoln -- became famous for the way in which it expressed the ideals of the civil rights movement.
* After President Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963, the new president, Lyndon Johnson, strongly urged the passage of the civil rights legislation as a tribute to Kennedy’s memory.

Voter registration

* In June 1963, medgar Evers, the NAACP Mississippi field secretary, was shot and killed in front of his home.
* In 1964, SNCC workers organized the Mississippi Summer Project to register African Americans to vote in the state, wanting to focus national attention on the state’s racism.
* King and SCLC members led hundreds of people on a five-day, five-mile, march to Montgomery
* The Selma March drummed up broad national support for a law to protect Southern African Americans' right to vote.
* The 24th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution was ratified in 1964. It prohibits both Congress and the states from conditioning the right to vote in federal elections on payment of a poll tax or other types of tax. 
* President Johnson persuaded Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which suspended the use of literacy and other voter qualification tests in voter registration.

Voter Registration

* Over the next three years, almost one million more African Americans in the South registered to vote.
* By 1968, African American voters had having a significant impact on Southern politics.
* During the 1970s, African Americans were seeking and winning public offices in majority African American electoral districts.

The End of the Movement

* For many people the civil rights movement ended with the deaht of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968. 
* Others believe it was over after the Selma March, because there have not been any significant changes since then.
* Still others argue the movement continues today because the goal of full equality has not yet been achieved.
