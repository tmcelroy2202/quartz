African Americans in Vietnam

* Prior to Vietnam, African Amreicans made up the highest percentage of enlistees into the US military
    * For this reason, a high percentage of soldiers in combat positions were African American during the war’s early years, when the fighting was done by volunteers.
* During the first several years of the war, blacks accounted for more than 20 percent of American combat deahts despite representing only 10 percent of the US population.
* Some civil rights activists, including Martin Luther King Jr. lashed out against the “cruel irony” of American blacks dying for a country that still treated them as second-class citizens.

Roots of Opposition - The New Left
