The Geneva Accords

* In response to the tense conflict between the French and Vietnamese nationalist (pro-independence), representatives from a number or nations (i.e. the United States, China, the Soviet Union, France, etc.) met at the Geneva Conference in 1954 to figure out how to resolve the conflict.
