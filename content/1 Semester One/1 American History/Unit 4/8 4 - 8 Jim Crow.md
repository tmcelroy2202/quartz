Jim Crow
* Most white Southerners resented the new rights of African Americans
* White Southerners will chip away at African American Rights

Who is “Jim Crow”?
* Is a highly stereotypical and exaggerated Black figure that was subject to white humor.

Effects of Plessy V Ferguson
*  To understand how these laws took root, we need to look at the court case that defined the idea:
* Plessy V Ferguson - 1896 

What parts of society were segregated? 
* Schools cemeteries, courts, hospitals, mental institutions, orphanages, prisons, & bibles to swear on in trials

Separate But Equal is **Never** Equal  
*  Exmple: Whites would never fund black schools equally
* Goes against 14th Amendment
African Americans Lost **Political Power**
* **Poll Tax** - had to pay to vote
* **Literacy Test** - Had to read to vote
* **Grandfather Clause** -  Could get around 1st 2 if your grandfather could vote

Results
* Lynching (900 from 1882 - 1892)
* Race Riots
* First Major Race Riot took plac in Wilmington NC in 1898
