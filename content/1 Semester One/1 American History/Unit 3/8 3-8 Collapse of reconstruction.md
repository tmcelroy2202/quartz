The Collapse of Reconstruction
* Some bitter southern whites relied on violence to keep African Americans from participating in politics.  
* The Ku Klux Klan ( KKK ) Was founded as a social club for Confederate veterans.
* Soon the Klan turned into a violent organization.  

The Collapse of Reconstruction, II

NC Senator John Stephens
* Stephens a white Republican states that 300 A. A. voters had supported him and he would not abandon them. 
* Stephens was assassinated by the KKK  in 1870.

Ulysses S Grant
* Grant becomes Secretary of War in Andrew Johnson's cabinet, a position he resigns from.
* He runs as Republican and wins easily ( 214 - 80 electoral votes ) with virtually no experience 
* Grant establishes the Department of Justice, the National Weather Service and our first national park; Yellowstone.
* Grant wins a second term (286 - 66 electoral votes) in 1872
* HOWEVER - trusting Grant did not manage his people which resulted in scandal and corruption

Enforcement and Amnesty Acts
* Grant passes Enforcement Acts in 1870 and 1871
* These were to give Federal support in Southern elections and Federal troops to curb Klan activity
* The Supreme Court declared the 1871 unconstitutional
* Klan violence eventually dies down as white supremacy is restored in the south.
* Amnest Act of 1872 restores voting rights to 150,000 former Confederates
* Congress allows Freedmen’s Bureau to expire

The Collapse of Reconstruction: Causes
* Ineffective Leadership which led to...
* Scandals
* Economic panic
* Lack of Judicial Support 

Republican Scandals

Scandals and corruption damaged Grant’s administration
* **Credit Mobilier Scandal**:  Railroad officials impoverished the railroad, then bribed members of Congress to block any investigation
* **“Whiskey Ring”**:  Internal revenue collectors accepted bribes from Whiskey distillers whow anted to avoid paying taxes on their product.

Economic Turmoil


Panic of 1873  
* The country has expanded after the Civil War.
* Investors took on more debt than they could afford
* Jay Cooke, a railroad investor, could not cover his costs or pay his debt
* Cooke’s banking firm went bankrupt
* Smaller banks closed, stock market collapsed, 89 railroads went broke
* 5 year depression was triggered, most blame Republicans

RESULT - This distracted many northerners from the task of Reconstruction
1873 - Slaughterhouse cases - Most Civil Rights were ruled to be state rather than federal rights and therefore unprotected by the 14th ammendment

1876 - US vs Crukshank - The 14th Amendment was ruled not to grant the federal government power to punish whites who opposed blacks - violence increased

1876 - U.S v Reese - The 15th Amendment was determined not to grant voting rights to anyone but rather to restrict types of voter discrimination - This allowed states to use poll taxes and literacy tests to discourage efforts to gain full equality

Election of 1876

Tilden v. Hayes
* Tilden won the popular vote, but needed one more electoral vote to win the presidency.
* A deal was made called the **Compromise of 1877.**
