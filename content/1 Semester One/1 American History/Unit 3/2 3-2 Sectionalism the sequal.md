Sectionalism - Politics

ESSENTIAL QUESTION
* How did increased division over the expansion of slavery and state's rights lead to open rebellion 

Sectionalism: 1850-1856
* Northerners were outraged by the Kansas-Nebraska Act:
* Congress allowed slavery to spread into an area of the United States which slavery was already outlawed in 
* Northerners formed the Republican Party in 1854 & became committed to the “free soil” movement
* Popular Sovereignty failed to settle the slavery question in the West
        * When a vote was held in Kansas in 1855 to decide on slavery, thousands of Missouri residents illegally voted
        * The illegal vote gave Kansas slavery when its residents voted against it 
        * In 1856, a war began between Kansas & Missouri (Bleeding Kansas)

Sectionalism: 1856-1860
* In 1857 a slave named Dred Scott sued for his freedom after traveling with his master from Missouri to Wisconsin
* The Dred Scott case presented the Supreme Court with 2 major questions:
* Does Congress have the power to decide on slavery in the territories?  
* Is the Missouri Compromise constitutional?

In Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857), the Supreme Court ruled:
        * Dred Scott had no right to sue because "blacks are not citizens"
        * Congress did not have the power to stop slavery in western territories so the Missouri Compromise was ruled  unconstitutional
        * Northern abolitionists are furious 

John Brown

* Involved in the Underground Railroad
* Moved to Kansas to support the anti-slavery cause
