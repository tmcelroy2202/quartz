The West - Populism

Essential Question
* How does war have the ability to change society 

Farmers Face Tough Economic Times
* Farmers in the west trapped in economic cycle due to falling crop prices.
    * During Civil War - Greenbacks were issued and could not be exchanged for silver or gold after the War
    * This increased the value of money already in circulation, but left farmers receiving less money for their crops
* Farmers also hit particularly hard by private ownership of the Railroad 

The Farmers Alliances
* 1867 - Oliver Hudson Kelley starts the Patrons of Husbandry (aka The Grange).
    * Original purpose was to provide a social outlet and an education forum for isolated farm families
* 1870s - The Grange’s battle shifts towards fighting the railroad and high shipping costs
    * Taught members how to organize, set up cooperatives, and sponsor state legislation to regulate railroads
* Membership quickly grew to 4 million farmers, mostly in the South and West
* Black farmers formed their own alliances because they were not permitted to participate in the southern farmers alliance 
The Populist Party
* 1892 - the populist party is founded to represent the alliance movement of the south and west
    * Demanded reforms to lift debt from farmers and other workers and to give people a greater voice in government.
    * Increase in money supply through Bimetalism - coining both gold and silver
    * 8 hour workday, immigration restrictions, direct election of senators, secret ballot, and a graduated income tax.
* Elections in 1892 - 5 senators, 3 governors, and 1500 state legislators. 

Panic of 1893
* February 1893 - multiple railroads go bankrupt due to the thin supply of gold within the federal government.
    * By the end of 1892 - 15000 businesses and banks collapsed due to money shortage
* Silverites vs Goldbugs - Bimetallism vs Gold Standard
    * Silverites - Favor Bimetallism (increasing money supply) - Southern and Western Democrats and Populists
    * Gold Bugs - Favor the Gold Standard ( maintaining money supply ) - Northern Republicans and business owners

1896 Presidential Election &  Bryan’s “Cross of Gold”
* Republicans Nominate William McKinley, committed to the Gold Standard
* Democrats Nominate Nebraska Congressman William Jennings Bryan.
    * Cross of Gold Speech given at the National Convention pleased the populists and caused them to support the democratic party in the election
* McKinley wins the Presidential Election due to a small split in the democratic party.
* Populist Party Legacy
    * the Downtrodden can organize and have political impact
    * Agenda of Reform
