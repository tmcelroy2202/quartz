# Reconstruction 
* A program put in place by the federal government to repair damage to the south and restore the southern states to the Union


December 1865 Newly elected legislators arrive in Washington
* Nearly all were Democrats
* Alexander Stephens was elected by Georgia (former Confederate VP)
* 4 were Confederate Generals  ( All were pardoned by Johnson )

Political Drama

Johnson - 1865 - 1869

* Johnson is a democrat. ( remember lincoln was a republican ) but he died shortly after winning re-election giving Johnson almost 4 years as president

* Johnson stays in the US Senate after Tennessee secedes. In a bid for re-election he was deemed a good fit as he was a Southerner and a Democrat and this showed inclusion by the Republicans

* Johnson had a strong state's rights mentality and puts a plan into place for reconstruction

* 1866 - Reconstruction is not off to a great start, as a result, many republicans win elections and take control in Congress including many Radical Republicans

Radical Republicans

* Radical Republican - A member of the REpublican part committed to equal treatment and enfranchisement of freed blacks. 

**Three Different Plans**

**Lincoln’s Plan

* *“Ten Percent Plan”**
* As soon as 10% of a state's voters took a loyalty oath to the Union, the state could set up a new government
* Secession was not constitutionally possible so South never really left; individuals not states rebelled
* no guaruntee of social or political equality for African Americans
* Pardon all confederate except high ranking officers and those committing crimes against POWs
* make this as quick and easy as possible 
* plan does not address land for freed slaves or voting rights

**Radical Republicans - Congress should lead**

Lincoln's plan angered members of his own party who wanted to punish the south as well as having full rights for African Americans.  

Led by Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner, these “Radical Republicans” in Congress insisted that the Confederates had committed high crimes.

The Radical Republicans passed the Wade-Davis Bill that required:
1. A majority of a state’s pre-war voters swear loyalty to the Union
2. Guaruntees of African American equality and the right to vote
3. Stricter plan for readmitting rebellious states

I don’t think so Thad!  Lincoln Vetos

V.P. Andrew Johnson became President after Lincoln’s death.  
1. States were to withdraw secession.
2. Swear allegiance to the Union.
3. Ratify the 13th amendment & draft a constitution that abolished slavery. 

(Did not support Blacks having the right to vote)

Johnson Battles Congress

Congress does not like his plan
* Expansion of Freedmen's Beautua Civil RIghts Act of 1866 -- ending of Black Codes by creating a federal guarantee of civil rights to African Americans.

Andrew Johnson would use his veto power to block these laws

Congress passed major legislation over a Presidents veto. The civil rights act of 1866 became law.

President johnson is impeached & 14th amendment passed. ( citizenship )

Congress passed the Reconstruction Act of 1867, which divided the 10 southern states into 5 military districts governed by former Union generals. The South would be reconstructed under the Radical Republicans’ plan.

Johnson’s Impeachment
* Brought up on 11 charges of high crimes and misdemeanors..
* Missed being removed from office by 1 vote.
* The presidency would suffer as a result of this failed impeachment
* President would be more a figure-head.
* Saved the separation of powers of 3 branches of government.
