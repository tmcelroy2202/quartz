# Turning the constitution's ideas into a real government

The Big Idea and Why It Matters
* The Big Idea: President Washington transformed the ideas of the constitution into a real government 
* Why it matters now: The cabinet and institution Washington created is still a key element of every presidential administration  

Judiciary Act of 1789
* provided for a Supreme Court consisting of a Chief Justice and 5 associate judges. It also set up 3 federal circuit courts and 13 federal district courts. It allowed state court decisions to be appealed to a federal court when constitutional issues were raised 

Alexander Hamilton
* picked by Washington to be the Secretary of the Treasury. He favored a strong central government and was a staunch federalist. Was in charge of running the economy and putting it on firm footing by managing the countries debts and managing the banking system. Frequently clashed with Jefferson.
* To win support for his debt plan, Alexander Hamilton proposed that the nation’s capital be moved from New York City to a new city in the south. (Washington D.C.) This plan pleased Southerns who felt that the government would be more responsive to their needs based on proximity. 

Thomas Jefferson
* Picked by George Washington to be the Secretary of State, he was a strong anti-federalist and a Democratic-Republican
* Favored an Agrarian society in which State's powers would reign supreme.
* Frequently clashed with Alexander Hamilton and would eventually resign from the Secretary of State position.

Cabinet
*  The president's chief Advisors.

Bank of the United States
* proposed by Alexander Hamilton, it would be a national bank funded by the government and wealthy private investors. It would issue paper money and handle tax receipts and other government funds. Set off a wave of controversy. Catering to the elite; possibly unconstitutional. 

Democratic-Republicans
* those who shared Thomas Jefferson’s vision of strong state governments. No relation to today’s Republican party. They favored popular government and agrarianism. Agrarianism is farming. ( Rule by farmers ) ( Farmers are the most important people because they feed you ) ( no farmers mean no food no food means you're dead )

Two-Party System
* two dominant political parties in Politics.
* Washington opposed a two party system because people will dislike and distrust people in the other party and will work against them. It will cause problems instead of solving problems. One party might join forces with a foreign government to gain power against the other party. 

Protective Tariff
* an import tax on goods produced in Europe. meant to encourage American production. Brought in a great deal of revenue.

Excise Tariff
* Tax on a a product's manufacture, sale, or distribution - to be levied on the manufacture of whiskey. Directly responsible for the Whiskey Rebellion in which Washington personally led the army to put down the rebellion. 

Whiskey Rebellion
* An armed rebellion of about 700 Pennsylvania rebels who were protesting the tax on distilled spirits (alcoholic drinks) of which whiskey was the most popular
* George Washington and an army of 13000 put down the rebellion with minimal bloodshed.
* Showed that the National Government had the will and ability to suppress violent uprisings without resorting to tyranny  

Protective Tariff of 1789
* First major piece of legislation passed after the ratification of the Constitution.
* It was to protect and encourage US manufacturing industries  
* Raise revenue for the Federal Government

# Tackling Foreign Affairs 

The Big Ideas and Why it matters
* The Big Idea: Events in Europe sharply divided American public opinion in the late 18th century
* Why it matters now: Foreign policy remains a key element of every Presidential administration 

Neutrality
*  President Washington issued a declaration of neutrality stating that the U.S. would not support either side in the French Revolution.  
* Hamilton and Jefferson eventually came to agree that war would not be good for the nation.

Edmond Genet
* A French diplomat, attempted to recruit Americans for the war against Great Britain (Jacobins declared war against them) 
* Violating American neutrality and ignoring diplomatic protocol. Eventually led to the resignation of Thomas Jefferson from the cabinet because of his support of the revolutionaries in France and his feud with Alexander Hamilton.

Thomas Pinckney
* U.S. minister to Great Britain, signed a Treaty with Spain (over fears of a united Britain and U.S. response).  Treaty of San Lorenzo giving the US all land of east of the Missisipi (except Florida), the use of the Missisipi river and the port of New Orleans. . 

Little Turtle & Native American Affairs
* leader of a Confederacy of Native American groups, a brilliant military strategist, in November 1791 his forces routed US troops under General Arthur St. Clair in the Battle of Mississinewa. Despite winning battles against the US eventually campaigned for peace. The confederacy would replace him for this.
* Native Americans had been excluded from the Treaty of Paris and continued to claim their tribal lands in the Northwest Territory.
    * The British continued to protect Native Americans in that area   
* Battle of Fallen Timbers - 1792
    *  American troops defeat Miami Native Americans in Ohio and march on to a fort nearby 

John Jay
* Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, negotiated the Treaty that gave America control over the land west of the Appalachian mountains. Britain had to cede their forts, however it allowede britain to continue its fur trade which angered many western americans..  

Sectionalism
* Placing the interest of one region over those of the nation as a whole. Big problem in the election of 1796. 

Washington’s Farewell Address
* A letter that Washington wrote at the conclusion of his second term in office. Here he declines a third term setting the 2 term precedent for the office of the Presidency.
* He also warned of the dangers of getting involved in foreign affairs and warned about the dangers of sectionalism and the 2 party system. .
