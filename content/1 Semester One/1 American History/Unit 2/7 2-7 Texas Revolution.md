Texas Revolution

**Central Historical Question:**

**Why did Texans revolt against the Mexican Government**

**Spanish Texas (1689-1821)**
* Texas became part of New Spain in 1519
* By 1800 there were fewer than 800 SPanish residents in the territory
* 1824 - After a 10 year war, Mexico gains independence
* Mexico rejected all offers to buy Texas during the 1820s and 1830s 
* Mexico encouraged American immigration.
* **Why would they do that**? 

Why did Mexico encourage American immigration? 
* Stem French encroachment ( rather have Americans that the French)
* Put down Native American hostility
* Help develop the economy
* Prevent illegal US encroachment as these immigrant had to adhere to certain requirements

**Mexican Texas (1821-1836)**

**Texian requirements**
* Convert to Catholicism
* Learn Spanish 
* Take Mexican Citizenship
* No slaves
    * The “Old 300” were the first official founding families led by Stephen Austin in 1824
	*  Most were wealthier and literate and 69 of the families owned slaves ( 1/4 of the total old 300 settlers )
    * This was the beginning of antebellum Texas slavery
    * Families received between 177 acres and up to 4428 acres for ranching

**The question of slavery**
* Cotton became a big part of the new economy
* Many Mexicans opposed slavery
* The Mexican government made several attempts to outlaw slavery but Texians challenged the laws or simply ignored them.

**Revolt**
* The first conflict took place on October 2nd in a small town called Gonzalez.  
* A Mexican soldier tried to confiscate a cannon given to the town to defend against Native American attacks. - 2 Mexican soldiers died.
* This built momentum for a revolution against the Mexican government

**The Alamo**
* This battle takes place beginning February 23, 1836.  
* 200 volunteers hold off the Mexican army of about 2000 for 13 days
* "Remember the Alamo" becomes the motto for the resistance against Mexico and a reason to fight.

**Independence**
* Over the next 6 months, Texans battled the Mexican army and won independence after defeating General Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto.
* Texas is now an Independent Republic.
