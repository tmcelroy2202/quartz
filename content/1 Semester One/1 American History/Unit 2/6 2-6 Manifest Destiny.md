**Manifest Destiny**
* Term used to express the idea that Americans were destined by God to settle North America from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean
    * Spread democracy and republicanism
    * Spread Protestantism
    * Support American's growing population

Americans Look Westward 
* Expansionists justified their views by pointing to the **weakness** of the Mexican government and economy. 
* They argued that the Mexicans, whom many Americans regarded as inferior, did not deserve to keep lands so badly needed for American settlement
* Expansionists were soon using the term Manifest Destiny to refer to the belief that **God** wanted the U.S. to own all of North America. 
* **Manifest Destiny ** - 19th century doctrine that westward expansion of the United States was not only inevitable but a God - Given right.

Americans Look Westward 
* There were many daring young American trappers who hunted for beaver pelts in the Rockies. Restless in their pursuit of furs, the Mountain Men thoroughly probed the Rockies, making important discoveries
* Restless in their pursuit of furs, the Mountain Men thoroughly probed the Rockies, making important discoveries.  

Americans Look Westward 
* In 1836, Marcus and Narcissa *Whitman* followed a different trail that led them to Oregon Country, this became known as the Oregon Trail.
* The Whitmans found an indian mission in Walla Walla
* In 1847, the Whitmans were killed by Native Americans who blamed them for a deadly measles epidemic.
* But by then, the tide of migration to Oregon was unstoppable.

Journey Westward
* Beginning in the springtime at the western edge of Missouri, the journey covered **2,000** miles and took about 5 months to complete.
* Emigrants traveled in trains in anywhere from 10 to 100 wagons and from 50 to 1,000 people. **Why?**
    * Safety in numbers - Small groups with supplies are more likely to get attacked and robbed, and having other people there lets you help take care of eachother
* The journey was a **gamble** that cost many their property and some their lives. Emigrants faced hunger exposure disease poisoned streams --  or worse
* Leadership passed on to Brigham Young, who was convinced that the Mormons could not survive among hostile neighbors.
* He led migrants across the Great Plains and the Rockies to establish the colony of New Zion on the eastern shore of the Great Salt Lake 

Reasoning:
* Christian duty/mission to extend (God-given right to)
* Civilize the Natives ( racial superiority ) 
* Safety valve ( release population " pressure" from the East) 
* No boundary blocking us
