Jackson:Nullification Crisis, Bank War and Legacy

Should Andrew Jackson have been impeached?
* Things to Consider:
* What are the possible consequences of impeaching a president? 
    * Intended? 
    * Unintended?
* How does impeachment impact understanding about the office of the presidency

Jackson‚Äôs actions during first term
* Held a rowdy party in the White House after being elected
* Implemented the spoils system with his political appointments
* Signed the Indian Removal Act of 1830 which led to the ethnic cleansing and forced migration of Native Americans in the Southeast U.S. A culmination of 30 years of American Policy. 


Impeach: Yes or No? 1 for no 5 for yes (color them)
I am saying 1 gavel, because it does not seem like this is that that that major. The spoils system isnt great but the Native American thing seemed like it was already happening, and the party is ok. Little unprofessional to throw a party at the white house, but not worth impeaching.

Themes of Jackson‚Äôs Presidency

**Native American Removal**
* Following Colonial precedent Jackson continues the removal of Native Americans
Tariffs in South Carolina & Nullification
* Southern states are defiant when tariffs are continually renewed hurting their economy. Sourth Carolina threatens to secede from the union
2nd bank of the US
* Jackson's mistrust and hatred of the banking system will lead to the collapse of the 2nd bank of the US 
Legacy
* New political party formed to challenge his beliefs 

Worcester v Georgia, 1832
* Indian removal was challenged in the Supreme Court -> Worcester v Georgia. 

Jackson & the Supreme Court
* Jackson ignored the Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling in Worcester v Georgia.
    * Paved the way for Indian Removal  
* Chief Justice John Marshall made his decision. Now, let him enforce it!

The Trail of Tears
* Route Native Americans, mainly Cherokee, were forced to take to new territory West of the Mississippi River. Removal started in 1830, Cherokee removal took place in 1838.

Two Perspectives of the Tariffs
* Summarize the Northern Perspective:  Foreign goods are made more expensive, so people buy more US goods, Northern industrial states profit from the increased business.
* Summarize the Southern Perspective: Foreign goods are made more expensive, so people buy more US goods, EU countries retaliate by buying less southern cotton, southern states economy suffer as a result, To appease European Merchants the south continue to buy European manufactured goods even though the tariffs make the more expensive than Northern goods 

Tariff of Abominations (1828, 1832)
* Name Southerners called the tariff of 1828 (raised rates 50%)
    * Stems from long history of sectional differences concerning tariffs
        * Environmental conditions ü°™ different economic system

John C. Calhoun & the Nullification Crisis
* Jackson‚Äôs 1st VP ü°™  John C. Calhoun
    * Huge falling out with Jackson & will not return as Jackson's VP for his 2nd term
    * Strong supporter of States‚Äô Rights 
* Reintroduced Nullification Theory arguing states did not have to enforce unconstitutional laws
    * The South would not pay the tariff
* South Carolina threatened to secede from the Union
    * Secede: to leave

The Force Bill
* Jackson's response to SC refusing to enforce Federal Law & threatening to secede
* Gives the President the power to use the military (Army & Navy) to force states to enforce Federal Law
    * South Carolinians wear palmetto patches to show support for secession
* Threatens to personally go to Charleston Square to hang John C Calhoun and all of his supporters.

Compare the two events - Whiskey Rebellion and SC Nullification Crisis.
* Whiskey Rebellion was peaceful, SC Nullification was much more extreme.

Impeach:  Yes or No?

Themes of Jackson‚Äôs Presidency

**The 2nd Bank of the US**
* Jackson's mistrust & hatred of the banking system will lead to the collapse of the 2nd bank of the United States 

Bank War Background
* Nicholas Biddle:  Became president of the Bank at age 37 (after only 4 years of being with the Bank)
    * Appointed to the Bank by President James Monroe
* The Bank was under private control with a charter from the Federal Government, allowing them to work together for mutual benefit.
    * Special benefits were granted to the bank
* Could use Federal money to make investments without paying interest (is this risky?  is this legal?)
* Guaranteed no bank competitors 
* Bonus of 1.5 million 

Bank War Background (Cont‚Äôd)
* The Bank becomes very powerful and could potentially manipulate national affairs.
* Biddle declared the 2nd Bank of the US was neutral in terms of politics and had no political agenda
* After winning the election of 1828, Jackson began to investigate the bank.
* Notified Biddle that several branches of the Bank had financially supported JQ Adams in the 1828 election ( violating the idea of neutral politics )
    * Biddle did not really investigate the claims, even as more evidence came out - drawing more anger from President Jackson

The Bank War: Biddle v Jackson
* Jackson believed BUS was too powerful because it was privately owned. 
* Considered it unconstitutional regardless of Marshall's McCulloch vs Maryland. 
* Should be controlled more by government and the people because it was corrupt.
* Nicholas Biddle, President of the BUS, Henry Clay, and Daniel Webster supported BUS.

The Bank War
* In an attempt to make Jackson look bad for the 1832 election, Biddle asks Congress to renew the Bank's charter 4 years early.
* Jackson ‚Äúbacks down‚Äù, but vetoes the law after Congress passes the new charter.

The Panic of 1837
* Financial crisis caused by various factors, including Jackson's war on the bank and other financial policies.
* Several state banks closed
* Overprinted paper money and could not pay contract loans to other financial institutions 
* Considered America‚Äôs 1st Great Depression

Legacy

* Political voice of the common man gets louder
* Controversial ‚Äì then & now!

Jackson Leaves Office
* Among other things, Jackson‚Äôs failing health was a main reason he did not run for reelection in 1836.
* Whig party was created in opposition to Andrew Jackson
    * The Whigs were opposed to an overly powerful president

* How did andrew jackson make the Presidency bigger & more powerful?
