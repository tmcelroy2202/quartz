    * Explored from St. Louis to the Pacific Ocean.

Aaron Burr

* Alexander Hamilton convinced the House of Representatives to select Jefferson as president.
* Burr killed Hamilton in a duel for costing him the Presidency

Louisiana Purchase
* The United States government spearheaded by Jefferson’s desire to expand westward purchased the Louisiana Territory from Napoleon for 15 million. 
* Included all land drained by the western tributaries of the Missisippi River doubling the US in size.

    * Cut back Hamilton's economic program by eliminating all internal taxes and reducing the influence of the Bank of the United States
* Declining influence of the Federalist party due to Jefferson's simplicity of the federal government.

12th Amendment
