Interpret the Political Cartoon:

Left political cartoon: The sentiment is that congress's spending was out of control and it was at a time in which the American Taxpayer did not have the money to spare for crazy government spending, and they did not feel heard when they complained. 

Right political cartoon: FDR is becoming more powerful than is reasonable because congress just keeps giving him more and more abilities.
