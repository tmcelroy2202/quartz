 Hoover’s Response to the Great Depression(1929-1930)

1.  Rugged Individualism:  Hoover believed government involvement to solve problems would actually led to more instability. Hoover called on business leaders to maintain production and employment. He  also relied on the American people to help eachother out during hard times. 

* In November 1929, Hoover invited business leaders to the White House and secured promises to maintain wages.  Hoover believed financial losses should impact profit, not employment or wages.

3.  No Direct Relief:  Hoover believed if the government provided direct relief to the American people, states, industry, and "American Neighbors" would no longer take the initiative to help.  Felt government aid would destroy neighborly good will and self-motivation to “pull yourself up from the bootstraps”.

* Asked Congress for a $160 million tax cut & to double spending on federal works program.

4.  Supporting Industry: Hoover abandoned the laissez fiare policies of the 1920s and bailed out big businesses, the railroad, and banks, by creating the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.  
 

* Secured promises to speed up the pace of large scale construction programs to aid employment  by 1930.
* Signed the Hawley-Smoot Tariff to protect American Agricultural and industrial sectors, backfired - European nations raised prices 

6.  Trickle Down Economics:  Hoover believed if the government supported industry, industry could remain operational and keep Americans employed.  He believed the benefits of prosperous businesses would benefit the public. Hoover relied on industry to share prosperity with their employees

7. Regarding the Continued Employment (1930):  To address the growing unemployment, Hoover created the President's Emergency Comittee for Employment to coordinate state & local relief program.  The PECE saw limited success due to lack of overall coordination.  Hoover calls on the Federal Reserve to extend more credit and persuaded congress to transfer agricultural surplus to the American Red Cross for relief efforts.

In 1931, PECE transitioned to the President’s Organization for Unemployment Relief (POUR) and raised millions for unemployment benefits, but could not meet the increasing needs as unemployment continued to increase.
