|As a young nation, America’s stance on foreign policy had largely been to adopt and maintain a position of isolationism (a policy of not forming alliances with other nations - see George Washington's Farewell Address).  When President Washington’s ambassador’s negotiated a trade agreement with Great Britain in 1794, other nations in the world were surprised - especially France.  France felt America owed loyalty to the French, as they had come to the aid of Americans during the revolutionary war against Britain.  Additionally, as a result of many lengthy wars with Great Britain and the French Revolution, France was in deep debt and would have benefited from a new trade agreement.  <br><br>  <br><br>To support  their economy, starting in approximately 1795, French navy and French privateers began the practice of impressment: seizing and stealing American trading vessels, their goods, and their sailors.  This angered many Americans and left them afraid of  France.  Hoping to avoid war, President John Adams sent diplomats to France.  During the meetings, French representatives known as X, Y, and Z demanded a bribe of $10 million.  They also threatened the United States with the “power and violence of France”.  <br><br>  <br><br>Many Americans feared that war with France was around the corner.  According to the 1790 census, there were approximately 11,200 French citizens living in the United States.  By 1798, the French Revolution had taken hold in France causing many French citizens to flee to the United States; the number of French citizens living in the United States was estimated to have grown to 25,000.  As rumors of French invasion and enemy spies living in the United States spread, fear took hold of the young American nation. In order to calm the fears of American citizens, Congress quickly passed laws in 1798 to make the United States more secure; these were known as the Alien and Sedition Acts.  These acts were supported by the Federalist party, who believed in a strong central government to protect the rights of the people.  They were not supported by the Republican party, who believed these laws violated the civil rights of Americans and were a sign of the government abusing their power.|

An Act Respecting Alien Enemies (1798): 

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|1<br><br>2<br><br>3<br><br>4<br><br>5<br><br>6<br><br>7|SECTION 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That whenever there shall be a declared war between the United States and any foreign nation or government, or any invasion...attempted, or threatened against the territory of the United States, by any foreign nation or government...all natives or citizens of the hostile nation or government, being males of the age of fourteen years and upwards, who shall be residing within the United States, and not American citizens, shall be apprehended, restrained, secured and removed, as alien enemies….|

  

1. Close Reading: Circle true or false under the statement below and explain your thinking. 
    

  

According to this act, in the year 1799, if the United States were to declare war against France, any male citizens of France older than 14 years living in the United States could be arrested and deported. 

  

True False   |  Why: They would be treated as hostile aliens and therefore deported if they are not American citizens they shall be apprehended, restrained, secured and removed as enemies. 

  
  
  
  
  

2. Analysis: How did this Act/law impact the civil rights of immigrants living in the US during 1798?
    

  

It had a negative impact on immigrants that lived in the US, because they didn’t have any rights in case of a war or an attempted occupation by another States or a foreign power. Many immigrants started having second thoughts about staying in the US or going back to their home-country.

  
  
  
  

3. Analysis: How does the Act Respecting Alien Enemies expand the powers of the federal government? 
    

  

The Act did indeed expand the powers of The federal government, because they could eventually use their ultimate power to get immigrants arrested without any problem and in bad faith. This could lead to a hard time for any non US citizen in America.

  
  
  

4. Analysis: :  How does war influence and impact the government's use of power?
    

The war could eventually lead to abuse  of power and create a scenario with a lot of tension between non citizens & citizens which could lead to a civil war in the US.

  
  
  

Sedition Act (1798): 

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|1<br><br>2<br><br>3<br><br>4<br><br>5<br><br>6<br><br>7<br><br>8<br><br>9<br><br>10|SEC. 2. And be it further enacted, That if any person shall write, print, utter or publish, or shall cause or procure to be written, printed, uttered or published, or shall knowingly and willingly assist or aid in writing, printing, uttering or publishing any false, scandalous and malicious writing or writings against the government of the United States, or either house of the Congress of the United States, or the President of the United States, with intent to defame [damage the reputation of] the said government... to bring them, or either of them, into contempt or disrepute; or to excite against them...the hatred of the good people of the United States, or to stir up sedition [rebellion] within the United States... encourage any hostile actions of any foreign nation against United States...being thereof convicted before any court of the United States having jurisdiction thereof, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding two thousand dollars, and by imprisonment not exceeding two years.|

  

1. Analysis: What influenced the passage of the Sedition Act of 1798?  Explain how the passage of this Act impacted Americans.  The Worries about French spies and French war were the driving force behind the Sedition Act. This made Americans unable / unwilling to speak out against the government, as it is now illegal.
    

  
  
  
  
  
  

2. Analysis: The First Amendment to the US Constitution says that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” Based on this, do you think Section 2 of the Sedition act is legal or illegal? Why?   It is definitely illegal. It makes it illegal to share your grievances, which directly goes against the First Amendment.
    

  
  
  
  
  
  

3. Analysis: How might the Sedition Act be applied to current circumstances or how could the Sedition Act impact freedoms and liberties guaranteed under the 2nd Amendment.
    

1. Would you be willing to give up your freedom of speech during a time of war in exchange for a guarantee of safety? Why or why not? No of course not because that could be abused by a government later on 
    

  
  
  
  
  
  

4. Analysis: How did the Sedition Act expand the powers of the federal government in 1798? 
    

Made them able to put people in jail for saying negative things about them.
