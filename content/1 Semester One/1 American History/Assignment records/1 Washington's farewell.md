|Objective|What struggles did the nation face at end of the 1700’s (18th Century), as a young country?|

  

|   |
|---|
|Directions: Read the three excerpts from President George Washington’s Farewell Address (1796) below and answer the corresponding analysis questions that follow.|

  

 Part 1:Unity   

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|1   2 3   4   5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13<br><br>14<br><br>15|"The name of American, which belongs to you..., must always exalt [to speak of]  the...pride of patriotism of the whole nation more than any feelings or concerns derived from local discriminations[concerns].  With slight shades of differences, you have the same religion, manners, habits, and political principles.  You have in a common fought and triumphed together; the independence and liberty you possess are the work in joint counsels, and joint efforts of common dangers, sufferings, and successes…. The North, in a dependent relationship with the south…finds great economic gains from the manufacturing and production of resources that come from the south.  The South….benefits from the work of the North, sees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand.  The tools the farmers in the South depend on are made in the North.  The East, ...finds improvement of communications by land and water...  The West is only able to expand from the East due to these improvements the East makes…While then, every part of our country thus feels an immediate and particular interest in union, all parts combined cannot fail to find in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength…."|

1. Close Reading: What is patriotism (line 2)? How is it different from local discriminations (lines 2 & 3)? 
    

  

Patriotism is a feeling of love, pride and priority for your entire country, which is different from your “local discriminations”, because your local discriminations are just the problems you have with your area, and patriotism is not just your local area, but your entire country. Even if your city is going through a rough time, you still love your whole country. 

  
  
  

2. Analysis: What does the phrase “must always exalt the ….pride of patriotism of the whole nation more than any feelings or concerns derived from local discriminations” (lines 1-3) mean? Means you must always consider the nation’s best interests and not selfishly lobby for prioritization of your own local region. You should not argue against beneficial things happening for the north just because you live in the south. 
    

  
  
  

1. What might have George Washington been noticing in the late 1800’s that led him to include this in his farewell address? George Washington might have been noticing a slow growth in people treating their sections of america as separate entities from the rest of america, and creating smaller factions.
    

  
  
  

3. Close Reading: What is Washington’s main idea in lines 6 – 13? 
    

Every part of America needs every other part of America equally. The North benefits from the South, the South benefits from the North, the East benefits from the West, etcetera. 

  

Part 2: Political parties 

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|1 2 3 4 5|"Let me now warn you in the most serious manner against the terrible effects of the spirit of political parties in general… sharpened by the spirit of revenge… a frightful abuse of power… this leads to a more formal and permanent cruel use of power.  Sooner or later, the leaders of these parties become the loudest voice, and turns the disposition into the purposes of his own elevation, and ruins the public liberty….”|

  

1. Close Reading: Does Washington agree or disagree  with the existence of political parties? 
    

Washington doesn’t agree with the existence of political parties. He is afraid of the possibility that the leaders of these could be involved in an abuse of power for their own good.

  
  

2. Evidence: Cite one piece of textual evidence from part 2 to support your answer to question A. 
    

  

Sooner or later, the leaders of these parties become the loudest voice, and turns the disposition into the purposes of his own elevation, and ruins the public liberty….

  

George Washington 

  
  

3. Close Reading: How do President Washington’s thoughts about political parties reinforce or support his claims about patriotism in part 1? Cite one piece of evidence from both parts 1 & 2 to support your claims.  
    

George Washington’s negative views about political parties being based around them being “sharpened by the spirit of revenge” support his idea in part 1 of splitting up Sectionalism being a terrible idea. In part 1 he says that “ the independence and liberty you possess are the work in joint counsels, and joint efforts of common dangers, sufferings, and successes “, meaning that if you are turning your fellow american into your enemy, you are making a grave mistake, as you depend on all of america to keep the nation running. ( The North needs the south, South needs the North ) 

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Part 3: Alliances 

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 <br><br>10|“Foreign alliances might be easy to forge and seem appealing, but such attachments or alliances are particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent patriot…Such attachment of a small or weak nation to a great and powerful nation dooms the smaller weaker nation to become a dependent of the great and powerful nation.  The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is in extending our economic relations, to have with them as little political connection as possible beyond that....Europe has a set of primary interests which to us have none; or a very remote relation. She is engaged in frequent controversies, the causes of which are essentially not our concerns. Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to bind ourselves by alliances…”|

  

1. Close Reading: According to lines 1 – 4, does Washington support or argue  against forming alliances with other nations? Cite evidence from the text to support your claims. 
    

Washington doesn’t fully support forming alliances with other nations. He prefers to avoid political connections and prefers to form alliances that could help the Country with the economy. He doesn’t want to be dependent on other, more powerful nations.  
  

Such attachment of a small or weak nation to a great and powerful nation dooms the smaller weaker nation to become a dependent of the great and powerful nation.

2. Analysis: What does George Washington provide as evidence in support of his claims? 
    

What Europe has going on right now and how it is not sustainable to help everyone who wants to fight Europe “ Europe has a set of primary interests which to us have none; or a very remote relation. She is engaged in frequent controversies, the causes of which are essentially not our concerns. Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to bind ourselves by alliances…” 

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  

3. Analysis: Compare and contrast Washington’s advice in the three sections.  How are his claims on unity, political parties, and alliances similar? How are his claims different? 
    

  

    His claims on unity, political parties, and alliances are similar in the sense that he is consistently lobbying for putting America as a whole first. His main priority is improving the entire nation’s standing, and doing it RIGHT, so that it lasts. He does not want to rush into anything that will not be sustainable long term. His claims are a little bit different in the sense that though he is arguing for a united America, he is not invested or interested in uniting with any other group, because he is worried about becoming dependent on them. 

  
  
  
  
  
  

4. Analysis: If you had to capture the main idea of the Farewell Address as a whole, what would that main idea be in one  or two sentences? 
    

  
  

Warn the nation about what lies ahead and give input to make the nation stronger. The most important thing is to keep the American ideals of Independence, Freedom, and Unity at the forefront.
