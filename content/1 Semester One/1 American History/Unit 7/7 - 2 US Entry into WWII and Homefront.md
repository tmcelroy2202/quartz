US Entry Into WWII and Homefront

* What events led the US to abandon its foreign policy of isolationism to enter WWII

WWII Breaks OUT & FDR TAKES a stand

* Delivered Quarantine Speech 
* Proclaimed that "war is a disease"
* The US should avoid it because it is deadly
* Instead of war, the US signs peace agreements, sought to quarantine (isolate) aggressive nations
* This was a reflection and reinforcement of America's traditional foreign policy of practicing isolation and neutrality 

Neutrality Acts

* These acts were congressional attempts at avoiding US involvement in WWII
* Revised US involvement in 1939
* Allowed FDR to sell goods and weapons to nations
    * The "Cash & Carry" Provision: These nations must pay cash and transported the goods themselves. ( Remember the Lusitania? ) 
    * This helped the Allies and violated true neutrality, but Germany was winning against the Allies and the US had to do something in the name of Democracy

FDR’s stance on the war changed

* After his re-election ( 3rd term ) FDR pushed for war.
* FDR delivered his Four Freedoms Speech suggested the only way Americans could keep their: 
    * freedom of speech
    * Freedom of worship
    * freedom from want 
    * Freedom from fear
* Help britain combat nazi germany and japanese militarism 

Lend-Lease Act Revisited

* US plan to sell, lease or lend defense materials to Allies
* This act was an economic declaration of war against Axis Powers
* Violated neutrality
* In response Germany starts to attack merchant ships delivering these war materials to Britain using U boats

What’s the BIG IDEA????

Well…

* America is practically fighting in WWII just with dollars and not bullets 

Pearl Harbor

* Japan relied on the US for natural resources ( specifically oil ) 
* US ended trade ( enacted an embargo ) with Japan... negotiations were unsuccessful
* In response, General Hideki Tojo sent troops to bomb the US  base of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941
* a surprise attack 
* 2,500 killed
* FDR asked Congress to declare war and America enters war with the Allies 

Effects of pearl harbor

* US starts to restrict the rights of Japanese-Americans living stateside because they were seen as disloyal and potential threats
* Government starts to detain Japanese-Americans in internment camps (temporary imprisonment)
* Korematsu vs US upheld the governement's ability to use internment camps against citizens during times of war 

America mobilizes on the home front

* Huge wave of patriotism following Peral Harbor Attack
* People enlisted, gave blood, volunteered
* People bought war bonds to fund the war, connected to victory
* Women’s Army Corps (WACs): gave army jobs to women - nurses, clerical work, typists, truck drivers, etc
* Rosie the Riveter became symbolic for women to show their war efforts making war materials

America Mobilizes

* War Production Board: oversaw the transition of peacetime industries to wartime industries in America
* I.E. Ford made planes not cars
* Other government agencies were created to distribute scarce resources, create patriotism
* Rationing: Americans were issued coupon books that limited the amount of certain goods they could buy
