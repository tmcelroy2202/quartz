Executive functioning: I believe that executive functioning is the ability to make complex decisions and consider all required variables properly.  

Real definition executive functioning: The group of complex mental processes and cognitive abilities ( such as working memory impulse inhibition and reasoning ) that control the skills ( such as organizing tasks remembering details, managing time, and solving problems ) required for goal directed behavior 

Eisenhower box:
Strategy for taking action and organizing your tasks
good time management reduces stress dramatically

Eisenhower matrix:
organize tasks by urgency and importance

Urgent + important = do first 
less urgent + important = schedule 
less important + urgent = delegate - give to someone else
not urgent + not important = delete
