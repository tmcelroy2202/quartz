What do you know about an experiment ? 

> Start with a hypothesis

Ok whats an example of a hypothesis?

> If i raise the temperature in this class to 99 degrees, your test scores will drop

Ok how do we test it?
We raise the temperature 
who raises the temperature?
me i'm the researcher ( teacher )

independent variable - temperature 
dependent - test scores 

So can we just give a test and raise the temperature and say that's it?
No
We need a control
We have one regular group test in regular temperature
We have one experimental group test in 99 degree temperature

How do we determine who goes in what group?
Random? 
How do we do random picking ?
Names in a hat? Alternate? We wanna randomize somehow. 
If we had a test and the right side of the room averaged a 95
and the left side of the room averaged a 55 on the first test
We know the right side is testing better than the left side
So it would'nt be random if the right side was one group and the left side was the other
that is a **biased sample** 
so you have to think about how you randomize it.

A good random chance would mean that anyone in the class had equal chance to be in either group.
