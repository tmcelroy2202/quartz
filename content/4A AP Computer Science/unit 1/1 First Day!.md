First day apcs 

Does use a phone holder which is incredibly lame. 

Icebreakers! i hate this

name: Thomas  / Tommy
One fun fact: Can type 150 wpm
What would i like to do after high school: Software engineering of some kind in college
Dream job: software development
one thing by the end of today:  get a couple forms from various classes signed 

this teacher is really very focused on the drilling into us that coding is important

She says FRQ's are written on composition notebooks but she said directly before that that i can do notes online, so im a little confused with that. 

obsidian git should work fine for this class though otherwise
