Consider the following code segment.

double num = 9 / 4;

System.out.print(num);

System.out.print(" ");

System.out.print((int) num);

What is printed as a result of executing the code segment?

A 2 2

B 2.0 2

C 2.0 2.0

D 2.25 2

E 2.25 2.0

I chose A

I have absolutely no idea why i chose A, I knew it was B, and i remember distinctly thinking about it still being a double on the first one so it would have a .0, but i chose A. The correct answer is B.

Consider the following code segment.

double x = (int) (5.5 - 2.5);

double y = (int) 5.5 - 2.5;

System.out.println(x - y);

What is printed as a result of executing the code segment?

A -1.0

B -0.5

C 0.0

D 0.5

E 1.0

I chose E. I did the casting wrong. 
The correct answer is D.
(int) (5.5 -2.5) = 3
(int) 5.5 - 2.5 = 5 - 2.5 = 2.5 
x - y = 3 - 2.5 = 0.5
