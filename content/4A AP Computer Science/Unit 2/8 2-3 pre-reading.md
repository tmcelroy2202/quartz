Methods define behaviours for objects of a class 
It is using turtle as a class for example
Turtle
* Turtle.turnLeft()
* Turtle.turnRight()
* Turtle.forward()

Procedural abstraction allows for a programmer to use a method without actually knowing how it works. I know that Turtle.turnLeft() makes the turtle turn left, but i do not really care how it does that. 

Methods in the same class can be called with just their name ( like normal functions. Think python. )

Methods outside of the class must use the syntax of object.method() ( Turtle.turnLeft() )

Method overloading occurs during compile time.
