We can traverse strings using loops
for ( int i = 0 ; i < string.length() ; i++ ) {
	System.out.println(string.substring(i , i + 1))
}

^ would loop through each character in the string and print each letter on the next line 
^ wouldve been useful for that reverse printing number thing from a while ago 
^ if we tried to do i <= string.length() we would get index our of bounds error 

we can also use 
charAt(int index)
to get a character at a specific index in a string 
charAt() is not on the ap exam so use substring so you learn it good

we can use string traversals to see how many characters in string are uppercase

we can replace substrings with other substrings
