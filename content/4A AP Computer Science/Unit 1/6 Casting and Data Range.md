1.6 is Scanner class
1.7 is Casting

Scanner class will not be touched on in the AP Exam
Makes coding fun though, which is why we do it
1.7 is all over the AP Exam. Type casting is important. 

Scanner is not a primitive datatype its a reference datatype its a class
every class has a constructor 
system.in is to grab the content from your keyboard when entered into the terminal

Casting explicitly is myInt = (int) myDouble
Casting implicitly is double myDouble = myInt

Double / int = double
int / int = int

casting double to int rounds it down only
casting double to int this way rounds it however way it should be rounded (int) (myDouble + 0.5)
