`war.java` is a java based implementation of war simulation.

`war.java` is:
* Blazingly fast
* Real World Accurate
* 20x the speed of professional war players
* Cloud Native
* Fully implemented in Java
* Safe
* Easy to use 
* Free
* Libre

# Installation
In order to run `war.java`, you will either need a copy of the JDK installed, or access to a cloud service  ( like CodeHS or repl.it ) which has it's own java environment. 

You are going to want to clone down the repository with git, or just copy in each class manually, then hit the run button. It will automatically know which class to start running, as it will find the class with the main method.


Documentation on each of the individual classes can be found below:
1. [[2 Card.java]]
2. [[3 Game.java]]
