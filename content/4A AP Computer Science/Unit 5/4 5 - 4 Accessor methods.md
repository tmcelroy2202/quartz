Accessor and mutator methods are used to control what aspects of a method users can alter

Accessor methods generally have a return value 
datatypes must match for return value and method signature

return value of an accessor is a copy of initial primitive value

this process is not the same as when we return objects to a program
if the value is an object then the existing reference is returned to the program, not a copy of the object.

both the flashes superpower and test's superpower reference thes ame speed object 

remember when a variable is assigned the value of an object it returns an existing copy of the object not a new one

tostrings always return a string type
