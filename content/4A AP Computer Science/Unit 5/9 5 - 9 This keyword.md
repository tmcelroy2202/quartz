This refers to the _ ___ object of the class 
int length;
public Rock (int length ) {

Shadowing is when a variable with more specific scope takes precedence over a variable with more general scope. 

that above is an example of shadowing and a way to use the this keyword to get around it. 

this is a reference to the current object whose methods and constructors are being called

we can use .notation to access the instance variables of the object. 
this can also be an actual parameter to pass an object to a method 
getArea(this) - passes entire Rock object into the method
