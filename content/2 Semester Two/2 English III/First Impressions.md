She has tutoring tuesdays and thursdays. You must make an appointment to go.

We always leave to the right 

We will be using springboard 

Books are just for the storied that are in them, everything she does is IN CANVAS!!!

YOU USE THE SLIDES ! You respond on the slides or on an assignment under the slides!! hype!! ( i hate paper ) 

start with unknown americans
ties in with our units ( units on infographic )
unit 1: american dream 
	instead of doing first essay first do gallery walk or presentation with visual representations of what you think it means to be an american
		then there is a essay for the second part
unit 2: power of persuasion : read the crucible :
	about the salem witch trials ( just what happens when rumors get started )
unit 3 : the american forum, speeches debates and news pieces
		you will write a newspaper 

unit 4: the eyes are watching god : the american journey and the harlem renassiance 

she expects you to turn your work in on time
when you do the work late the worst thing you can do is ask when shes gonna grade it
when you turn staff in late she doesnt go back and look ( what does that even mean ?? )

you dont need a folder or small binder

if you prefer to write in a novel you buy your own novel

you will need your chromebooks and you will need to have them charged. 

Honor code and cheating:
	please just dont cheat, you dont have to. there is no reason to cheat in this class.
		essays need to be your own work but most other things are in groups or with a partner. if you prefer to work alone thats fine. if you get in a group and somebody in the group isnt working "let me know and ill give em credit" ????? 
		
avoid plaigarism by using citations 

everything is always "on here" ( referring to the infographic document )

shes very anti cellphone

the second the bell rings they go away. no phones after class either.

During homeroom - no cell phones. 

give her 24 hours to respond to an email 
if you email her over the weekend shes not going to respond
friday at 2:45 shes done until monday morning
"she doesnt bother you over the weekends dont bother her"

during the weekday dont expect her to respond after 5 oclock. 5 oclock is pushing it. when she leaves she shuts her computer down and shes not looking at anything myers park related till the next day 

her time is her time and my time is my time.

she needs to stop watching tik toks at 2 in the morning
she drinks a coffee and then she needs a celcius 

you dont have to ask to go to the bathroom, you just grab the thing and go.

when she came back to school post covid :
	she thought juniors can listen to music and work
	district says you cannot


just about everything is group work and she does not want you to stop talking.
if you like to work in the quiet you ask her if it can be quiet and she can make that happen.

# Organizing that information during SEL:

## Pros
* All assignments seem like they are online
* All Submissions for those assignments seem like they are online
* She seems genuinely interested in making this an environment which is well optimized for each person to learn how they learn best
* We have a few interesting topics im excited for:
	* American Dream Unit
	* Speech and Debate 
* She implied that she wont be giving homework ( Your time is Your time and My Time is My Time. I don't bother you over the weekend. )
* No need for a folder or paper materials she said.  Pretty hype for that. 

## Cons
* No Music ( Unless she gets the crappy CMS earbuds)
* It's looking like shes not going to let me use SEL time to do whatever I please like I had before in Homeroom
* Very anti cellphone. Seems to believe it is just enforcing of district policy. Do not know if that is truth or not. Wonder what she will think of my beepy. 

## Mediums
* Group work focused class 
* Does not prioritize speedy grading of late work.
* If you are not in the class by the time she walks in, you are late.
