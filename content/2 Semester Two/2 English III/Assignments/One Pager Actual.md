Mayor's goodbye to Maribel:

"You could come back one day," I said. "Or I could come there." 
"Maybe"
"I could find you"
Maribel shook her head. "Finding is for things that are lost. You don't need to find me, Mayor." ( pg 263 ) 

For Maribel's accident:

One rung. Two. Then, a noise. Some-thing clattered off to the side. I startled and turned. I must have jerked the ladder. It slid in the mud on the ground from the rain the night before. And when i turned back again, it was as if the world was unspooling in slow motion. I saw Maribel's body tilt backwards. She let out a sharp scream. She reached her hand for the ladder but her fingertips only grazed the rung. Arturo yelled. Maribel dropped two stories to the ground below. Her body smacked against the mud, sending it splattering into the air, all over me, all over Luis. Her neck snapped back. Her eyes closed. ( pg 101 )

For meeting Garrett at the gas station : 

But this boy looked. He looked because he didn't know. And the way he looked made me uncomfortable

I pulled Maribel closer and edged us backwards.

The boy took a step toward us.

I moved back again, holding Maribel's elbow. Where was Arturo? Wasn't he done by now? 
The boy picked up his skateboard, tucking it under his arm, and started towards us, when suddenly -- Â¡Gracias a Dios! -- the gas station door opened. Arturo walked out, holding a plastic bag in one hand and shaking his head. ( pg 11 )

Interpretation of Mayor's goodbye to Maribel:

Maribel coming to America and meeting Mayor has changed Mayor's life in a big way, and they seem to really like each-other, but in this moment it becomes clear that Maribel is going to be Okay with leaving Mayor. It becomes clear that nothing needs to be done to follow her. It becomes clear that Mayor is just going to have to accept that it is over. This was an entirely new experience for him and this has meant the world to him and its all coming to an end. 

Interpretation of meeting Garett at the Gas Station:

This quote is showing the beginning of their terrible interactions with Garett. It is beginning what eventually leads to Arturo's death. It is introducing a character that will continue to be villainlike for the rest of the story-line, and it is showing immediately that he is going to be evil for the rest of the story. Arturo getting there allows the author to postpone the date of anything bad happening to later, but it also shows how unsafe America, and really just life as a whole can be without a person like Arturo present, especially for women. 


# Personal Response:
*The Book Of Unknown Americans* was a pretty wild ride. It was most definitely not what I expected from a book we are reading for school, but it was moving, engaging, and showed perspectives you don't often see. I went into *The Book Of Unknown Americans* expecting for it to have had its quality over-represented to me, after being told people were singing high praises in her other classes. I did not think that was even really possible, high schoolers are not known to sing high praises of anything that they are told to do. This book was legitimately very good though, and it did legitimately have me wanting to read more. It showed varying perspectives which were all hugely different enough that seeing their interaction evoked emotion and made me think.  All of the characters seemed to have consistent personalities throughout the book, or atleast understandably evolving personalities throughout the book, and I enjoyed that. They never seemed to make comically bad decisions, or do anything completely absurd, which I am not used to from media I absorb. It had a lot more profanity and sexual scenes than I am used to for books assigned by school, but none of that profanity seemed unnecessary, it all seemed representative of who the characters are.
