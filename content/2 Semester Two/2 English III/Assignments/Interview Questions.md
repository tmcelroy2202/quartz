pick six questions
multi part questions are all one question

3. What makes you the happiest?
I don't know if I can say what makes me happiest because a lot of things make me similarly happy. I enjoy hanging out with friends, I enjoy making my life easier.

5. What is your most frequent emotion?
My most frequent emotion is joy. I spend a grand majority of my life happy. I have optimized most of my life so that I can be as happy as possible as much of the time as possible.

9. Do you think you can have an impact on the world -- make a difference in life, and if so what kind of impact do you think you can have?

11. Where do you get most of your information?

The Internet. I don't watch TV, I don't get information from phone calls, I don't really use mobile apps for information either. The Internet is most definitely the most important source of information for me. A large portion of the information that I want on a day to day basis comes from obscure forums for tech stuff. Every problem that I have ever had is a problem someone else has had at some point, and that person likely solved the problem, and they likely also posted their solution to the internet. 

16. If you could be someone else in the world -- who would that be and why?
That depends on how this works. If I am that other person, does my brain still work how my brain works, or do I have their personality? If I have their personality and their brain, is it even me? Isn't that still them? 

If it's just my brain in their body then I would want to be any billionaire. There are very few problems that I ever have that a billion dollars wont solve.  I'll say Jeff Bezos.

17. As you look ahead in your life what do you think you will become ? Fantasy ? Reality ? 
I think realistically I will grow up to do software engineering or something in the IT space. I already have a number of hobbies in that area and I already know plenty on the topic, and I think it is very realistic that at some point I will get a job in that space. In a Fantasy world where I can do whatever my heart desires I would be a Free and Libre Open Source Software developer for a large company. I would be paid by a company to build and lead development on open source tooling. 

* Describe something you have done or accomplished that you are proud of 

10. Tell me about your family
I do have a mother and father, they get along pretty well, and I live with them. I get along with them pretty well too. I do not have any brothers or sisters. I think family is important, and I would want a family of my own at some point, I dont know what "kind" of family means, and I don't know what I would consider a perfect family to be, I don't even know if that's a standard that is healthy to try to hold a family up to. 



# Mattia Questions:

What makes you the happiest?
Seeing the progress I make throughout my life sofar, and seeing how my personal relationships grow with me, gettting peple to smile is one of the most incediblye things i can think of that makes me happy. 

What is your favorite way to spend a saturday?
Saturday would be usually a basketball game day meeting up with the team having a laugh playing together winning losing and based on if its a home or away game i would then meet up with my friends and leave to go work as a DJ at a local club 

What bothers you the most about yourself?
The incapability of expressing myself the right way based on the language that I speak. Speaking 3 languages means epxressing myself in 3 different ways depending on the words and the type of conversation

How do you feel about discrimination? Discrimination belongs in the history books and we get reminded of it every single day and there is no such thing as unity nowadays and we live in a society where the vision to live all as one has not been achieved. So letting people be who they want to be as long as they dont bother others in order to spread their way of thinking is fine by me. 

This example can also be used in current religious conflicts 


What grade are you in?
Senior at myers park, this is my exchange year abroad, so after this school year I will have to go back to italy and finish High School there. 

What is your greatest dream?
My greatest dream is to live my life surrounded by my passions, getting to travel, experience ew ultures, meet new people and get to know different industries. I have more than one passion, i play basketball, golf, i ski, and other than that I also like non sport related activities like the marketing industries and family businesses which i am the 5th generation of. Being able to be a part of it all and leave my mark wherever i go and be remebered for who I was and for what I've done would be the greatest gift I could ever ask for.

# Mattia

Mattia seems to live one of the most fulfilling lives that I have seen from a teenager. As we talked I constantly realized how well fleshed out of a person he is. I already knew Mattia at a surface level from having first block American History with him last semester. We sat next to eachother. I learned a lot more about Mattia today than i did that entire semester. I already knew Mattia played basketball, but I did not know that after home games, Mattia would DJ at a local club. This isn't something you really get to do in America, but in Italy, where Mattia is an exchange student from, clubbing is legal at 16. 

Mattia is a senior right now, and once he completes high school, I learned he would like to go into his [Family Business](http://felicetti.it/) which is Felicetti Pasta, but that is nowhere near all he wants to do. He would love to also be able to have golf as a hobby, and be on the board of directors of a golf club. He would like to sponsor a ski team, preferably the italian national team. He would like to be a ski instructor himself, as a part time job. He would like to get into music. He would like to get into events programming and organization, and thats why he is DJing right now, so that he can eventually own his own club. He would like to own his own basketball team. 

The Family business would be his primary source of income, but he is a very passionate person, and he has a number of built out interests outside of it. He seems to have figured out what he wants in a way that I very rarely see from teenagers. A majority of my friends can barely tell me even a vague idea of what they want to do professionally. His passions extend past that too, and he has hobbies fleshed out in a way that I don't see very often. He started building desktop computers when he was 12, and talked about different graphics cards, with him especially liking the 2070 super series by nvidia. This isn't something I see very often from my peers,  I was impressed by Mattia's clarity in expaining all of this, and I was impressed by how passionate Mattia was while explaining each answer. They are get to know you questions for an English class, and it would be easy to phone them in, but Mattia seems to think that if he is going to do it, then why not give it his all? 

With all of his willingness to try new things, and with his love for travel, he has picked up one problem though. He speaks 3 languages, and he is worried about his ability to properly express himself. Knowing 3 languages means he knows what he wants to say, but he may not know how to say it in your language, and hes been struggling with that. Even in this interview, there were a few moments where he needed me to help him with a word. He knew the concept he wanted to express, but he couldn't really express it without help, and that is in large part because of how multilingual he is. He some amount of time speaking each language, and this means he loses out on picking up more obscure vocabulary from any individual language. I think this is a valid concern for Mattia, but honestly he is expressive enough and can convey the idea well enough that I doubt it will be a major problem.
