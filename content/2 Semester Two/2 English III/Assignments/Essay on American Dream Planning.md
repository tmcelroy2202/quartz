Hook: We have all heard about the American Dream, a dream of freedom, a dream of equality, and a dream of new beginnings. This dream though, over time, has slowly deteriorated. We no longer need people to move to America to explore the western frontier. The Homestead act is (mostly) dead. 

Hook: The American Dream is a commonly mocked idea. People often look at the American Dream as patriotic fodder for dads at barbecues, wearing American flag shorts. It is viewed as a relic from a time when America was young, no longer relevant now that America is fully commercialized. This is not an unfounded claim, according to a Wall Street Journal survey, only 64% of Americans believe the American Dream does not "still hold true". They are incorrect though, as the American Dream is definitely still alive and well.

Hook: The American Dream, as a whole, was never achievable, or atleast not under capitalism. The idea that everyone is free and equal and the only thing that will make or break your success is YOU, as a person. This could never have been the case, as there are too many other factors involved. A person's education, stereotypes about groups they fall under, the economic status of their parents, the quality of their parents' parenting, it all plays in to who they are now, and that messes with that idea that the only thing driving your success is you. You couldn't really move here with nothing and make it big, because if you have nothing, how are you affording a plane ticket ? If you have nothing, you wont be able to afford rent. If you have nothing, and come on a work visa, how will you ever get upward mobility? 

Hook:  The Youth of America may not believe in the American Dream, but it is still achievable for some 

Hook: The American Dream, when it was born, did not include a lot of what it was known for today. The American Dream, at its core, was for the American settlers ( the white ones ), to escape the taxation without representation they were dealing with from Britain. They were dreaming of self governing, and they were dreaming of cheaper tea. They were not even considering the idea that immigrants who were not white might be relevant to this dream. Since then though, the American Dream has expanded. It is no longer about that wish to escape taxation, it is now about a wish to escape oppression, or poverty, or crime. Though it is still a wish for a blank slate, it is no longer wished by the same people. The old version of the dream is no longer relevant. We actually do have taxation without representation right now, and no one really cares. Children who cannot vote pay sales tax. The new version of the dream though, the one focused on coming from nothing to 

Hook: Here's a cliche: Webster's dictionary defines the American Dream as "an American social ideal that stresses egalitarianism and especially material prosperity". That is a lot of big words, so lets break that down real quick. Egalitarianism is defined as "  The political doctrine that holds that all people in a society should have equal rights from birth. ". Webster's dictionary is saying, in much vaguer terms, that all men are created equal, and granted certain unalienable rights, and none of those men should be restricted from achieving their dreams. When America was founded, this focus was on class not restricting people achieving their dreams, and not really other factors. This is to some degree still achievable, if a person moves here with nothing, they can build a pretty decent life for themselves, assuming they are educated, white, and have valuable skills. The Original American Dream, the one where a person can move to America with nothing and create a good life, is still an achievable one, but some of the things the American Dream has evolved into are not achievable. The American Dream has evolved, slowly, and over time, into a 


Hook: The American Dream is one which is often ridiculed by nihilistic teenagers. An idea no longer considered relevant by the youth of America, because it is one which implies America is different from everywhere else, in a way which makes America better. Young Americans do not resonate with this idea. Young Americans see problems everywhere around them. Even though this is the case, the American Dream is most definitely not dead, it is still entirely achievable. 


FIND SOMETHING I CAN COMPARE THE AMERICAN DREAM TO in high speed. 

i think that i can probably find a pop culture phenomenon that has a similar thing going on to the american dream - widely hated or not believed in, but still totally alive. 

Hook: The American Dream has a similar reputation to the movie avatar 

Hook: People often dismiss the American Dream as something no longer achievable. A relic from when America was young.

dont copy and paste, hit submit, file upload, and then single file upload from your google docs. 
you're also gonna see if you're in the green yellow or red - green means you're good, asin, not using more quotes than you do information. when you get in the yellows and the reds, shes wondering how good the paper will be. if you get a yellow make your quotes smaller.
