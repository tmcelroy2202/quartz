one should always work hard
one should strive to live a simple life
people must work together for the good of the community 
people must conform to maintain order
vanity is sinful
there is no time or place for leisure
any activity not done for god is sinful
God comes before everything
one should fear god and his punishments
children should be seen and not heard
religious differences should not be tolerated
education is important only so that one can understand god's words
one should repress their emotions
women should marry and bear children
men are above women
