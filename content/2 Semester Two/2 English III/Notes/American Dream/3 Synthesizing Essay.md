Synthesize atleast 3-5 sources and your own observations to defend challenge or qualify the statemnet " america still prvoides access tot he american dream " you must make a coherent well written argumentative essay. your argument should be central; your sources should support that argument. 

We're gonna go through all the stages:
Planning and prewriting: 
	What are the elements of  a strong paper ? How can you use these elemnts as a sort of to do list for your planning 

Drafting: 
	How will you voice your position without overlooking the nuances and complexities of the topic
	what assumptions and beliefs will you say and base upon your sources
	how do the ideas in your sources relate to the position ? 
		do not put evidence in there that doesn't support what you're saying. 
			even in a counter argument, you need to be able to refute that counterargument.

Evaluating and Revising
	do you consistently show how each quote relates to your central position 
	How can you make sure your syntax is complex and varied, especially the openings of your sentences
	Are your ideas sequences in a way that guides your reader to reaching the same conclusion you did ? 


Any time you are writing always keep a rubic infront of you. 

transitions should enhance coherence
do not restate a thesis for her ever.
do not get to the end and say " based on these things america still provides access to the american dream " go beyond what you already told her, and tell her how your evidence gets back to that point.

You do not need I all the way through your paper 

don't write her a paper with ai because turnitin.com will " light you up " ( fake news )
turnitin detects duplicate papers from other teachers which is interesting. "this paper has been submitted to the university of wisconsin. " That is such a cool feature and thats pretty damn cool.

# Context on Author
her father was an immigrant 
he came and met her mom 
they got married
he has stayed for more than 40 years now
her mom said " no one from the newspaper will ask for her dads story "
she thought she had the power to tell stories like her dads
telling all these stories of all these different immigrants all over latin america
not only immigrants from latin america but all over the world should have their stories told, it would be nice to continue the spirit of that, unknownamericans website is for submitting those stories with a photo of themselves. 

she thinks it is really important for us to hear those stories and understand that so often there is not that much that seperates us, there seems to be this idea that immigrants are somehow bad, but when you start reading these stories it breaks down these walls and these stereotypes, because you see that they are just like you.
