Function:


Negation:
Excludes items that are not intended to function within the definition, helps establish a limit to what you're talking about. Essentially setting boundaries. Freedom does not mean being able to do whatever you feel like, and doesn't mean you won't face consequences. 

" being a high school student does not mean i have to go to all the sports events"
using negation to define what being a high school student is

Exemplification: using examples to illustrate your points
dress codes are infamous for targeting specific students, for example rules about midriffs bra straps, etc all target one group. 

Function Using the purpose or consequences of a feature to help explain something 
In paragraph one bejan says free speech for some they argue serves only to silence and exclude others. Denying hateful or historically privileged voices a platform is thus necessary to make equality effective, so that marginalized and vulnerable can finally speak up.

Classification / Division: putting things into categories 
you're not gonna put your bedroom sheets in with the dishes, if you're moving. They go to different categories.  

Presentation needs:
thesis statement at the beginning of the slides
we are not writing the essay
you are going to give her 3 things that being an American is
Everything else you do is visuals to support your thesis statement 
I should be able to look at your thesis statement and your visuals and know you understood the assignment:
being an american means the right to a free education, public education, in grades k-12 
your visuals should then be about the education system, not pictures of a mall. 

you can:
draw the pictures
look them up online ( give credit )
make a collage of different things ( students, textbook, public school )

it must be well organized
each picture must lead into the next one
