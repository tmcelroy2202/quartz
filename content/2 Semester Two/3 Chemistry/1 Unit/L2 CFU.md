THE ATOM Lesson 2 Check for Understanding

Part ONE: Working with Isotopes  

Directions: Use the information provided and your Reference Tables to complete the table.  Assume all atoms are neutral.

  

|  | Isotope Notation | Name | Mass Number | Atomic Number | # Protons | # Neutrons | # Electrons |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1. | <sup>13</sup><sub>6</sub>C | Carbon-13 | 13 | 6 | 6 | 7 | 6 |
| 2. | <sup>21</sup><sub>6</sub>K | Potassium-40 | 21 | 19 | 19 | 22 | 19 |
| 3. | <sup>22</sup><sub>10</sub> Ne | Neon-22 | 22 | 10 | 10 | 12 | 10 |

| 5. | <sup>64</sup><sub>30</sub>Zn | Zinc | 64 | 30 | 30 | 34 | 30 |
  

6.  Define Isotopes.
isotopes are atoms of the same element that have the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons or mass number 
  

7. Which atoms (if any)  in the table above are isotopes of each other?  
None, they all have different atomic numbers / amounts of protons. They are not atoms of the same element. 
  

8.  Which of the following has the smallest mass?  

  

1. Proton b. Electron c. Neutron d. Their Masses Are Equal 

Electron


9.  The letter "Y" in the diagram marks the (check ALL that apply):

- [x] Location of the Protons                                                              ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/NO32w8yKYtEwEfwlS_ex5bd8B_9B2J7cSjtuHQo7m0bcK2LGcjckzvdWahSVHj6ib7tT2-aAijUxGEhOcyYnwebMU_qlcQU0uJ8zytzVpnsktEa6vrZcM4tH3ZBDr9BzYtgRYxiqGhz3kmE)

10. Of the basic atomic particles, the one that would be attracted to a negatively charged metallic plate is the: 

1.   Electron
    
2.   Neutron
    
3.   Proton
    

  
  
  
  

Part TWO:Calculating Average Atomic Mass round all answers to 2 decimal places

11. Calculate the average atomic mass of bromine. One isotope of bromine has an atomic mass of 78.92amu & a relative abundance of 50.69%. The other major isotope of bromine has an atomic mass of 80.92amu & a relative abundance of 49.31%.

  

show your work

(78.92 * .5069) + (80.92 * .4931 )
79.9062
79.91
  
  

12. Calculate the average atomic mass of sulfur if 95.00% of all sulfur atoms have a mass of 31.972 amu, 0.78% has a mass of 32.971amu and 4.22% have a mass of 33.967amu.

  
show your work

(31.972 * .9500) + (32.971 * .0078 ) + (33.967 * .0422) 
32.0639812
32.06
  
  

13. The average atomic mass for gallium is 69.723 amu.  What is the mass of the lighter isotope if Ga-71  (70.9249 amu) has a percent abundance of 39.6 %?  

show your work
69.723 = (70.9249 * .396 ) + ( x * .604 )
69.723 =  (28.0862604) + (x * .604)
41.6367396 = x * .604
68.9349993377 = x  
^ ( i did 41.6367396 / .604 here. just solving like a normal equation.)
68.93


  
  
  
  
  

14. Conceptual:  No calculation needed.

There are three isotopes of silicon. They have mass numbers of 28, 29 and 30. The average atomic mass of silicon is 28.086amu. Which isotope has the highest % abundance and which has the lowest?

  

Highest  28 Lowest 30
