Half-Life Calculations (SHOW ALL WORK!!)

  

1. Suppose we have 100 nuclei of a radioactive isotope. After one half-life, half of the nuclei will have disintegrated, 

     leaving 50 nuclei.

a. How many nuclei will be left after the second half-life?
100 - > 50 - > 25 
  
  

b. How many nuclei would you predict would remain after the third half-life?
100 - > 50 - > 25 - > 12.5
  
  

2. Element X has a mass of 300g and a ½ life of 10 years. How many grams will remain after 40 years?

Hint: first determine how many ½ lives in 40 years.

40 / 10 = 4 

300 - > 150 - > 75.0 - > 37.5 
  
  
  
  

3. Element Z has a mass of 430g. Scientists determined it to have a ½ life of 5 years. How many grams of element Z will

    remain after 15 years? Show your work. Hint: first determine how many ½ lives
	
15/5=3

430 - > 215 - > 107.5 - > 53.75 
  
  
  
  

4. Phosphorus-32 is a radioisotope with a half-life of 14.3 days. If you start with 4.0 g of phosphorus-32, how many 

    grams will remain after 57.2 days? How many half-lives will have passed? Hint: first determine how many ½ lives
57.2 / 14.3 = 4
4.0 - > 2.0 - > 1.0 - > 0.5 - > 0.25 

  
  

5. Sodium-24 has a half-life of 15 hours. How much sodium-24 will remain in an 18.0-g sample after 60 hours?

Hint: first determine how many ½ lives

60 / 15 = 4 

18.0 - > 9.0 -> 4.5 - > 2.25 - > 1.125 
  
  

6. After 42 days, a 2.0-g sample of phosphorus-32 contains only 0.25 g of isotope.  What is the half-life of phosphorus-32? Hint: first determine how many ½ lives

2.0 - > 1.0 - > 0.5 - > 0.25

3 

42 / 3 = 14 
  
  
  
  

7. 8.0g of phosphorus-32 takes 6 weeks (42 days) to arrive from the lab in Europe.  Its half life is 14 days.  What is the

     amount remaining? Hint: first determine how many ½ lives

42 / 14 = 3 

8.0 - > 4.0 -> 2.0 - > 1.0 
  
  
  
  
  
  

8. Iodine-131 has a half life of 8 days. What fraction of the original sample would remain at the end of 32 days?

Hint: first determine how many ½ lives

32 / 8 = 4

1 - > .5 - > .25 - > .125 - > .0625

1/16 
  
  
  
  

9. The half-life of chromium-51 is 28 days. If the sample contained 510 grams, how much Cr-51 would remain after 56  

    days? Hint: first determine how many ½ lives
	
56/28 = 2 

510 - > 255 - > 127.5
  
  
  
  

10. If 20.0 g of a radioactive isotope are present at 1:00 PM and 5.0 g remain at 2:00 PM, what is the half life of the 

    isotope? Hint: first determine how many ½ lives

5 - > 10 - > 20 

1 hour / 2 = 30 minutes 

  
  
  
  

11. The half life of iodine-125 is 60 days. What fraction of iodine-125 nuclides would be left after 360 days? 

Hint: first determine how many ½ lives

360 / 60 = 6 

1 - > 1/2 - > 1/4 - > 1/8 - > 1/16 - > 1/32 - > 1/64 

1/64 of the nuclides would be left 
  
  
  
  
  

12. Titanium-51 decays with a half life of 6 minutes. What fraction of titanium would remain after one hour?

Hint: first determine how many ½ lives

60 / 6 = 10 

1 - > 1/2 - > 1/4 - > 1/8 - > 1/16 - > 1/32 - > 1/64 
  
  
  

13. A medical institution requests 1.0 g of bismuth-214, which has a half life of 20 min.  How many grams of 

      bismuth-214  must be prepared if the shipping time is 2.0 hrs? Hint: first determine how many ½ lives

 120 / 20 = 6 
 
 1.0 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2
 
 64 
 
 64 - > 32 - > 16 -> 8 - > 4 - > 2 - > 1 
 

  
  
  

14. Strontium-85 has a half life of 65.2 days.  How long will it take for 20.0 g to decay to 5.0 g? 

Hint: first determine how many ½ lives

20 - > 10 -> 5 

65.2 * 2 = 130.4
