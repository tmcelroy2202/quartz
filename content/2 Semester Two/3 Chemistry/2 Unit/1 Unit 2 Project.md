Unit 2 Project

As a team of 4 in your breakout group, complete the following parts for each of your assigned elements. Submit one document for your group. 

  

You will break apart into 2 smaller groups and each subgroup will work together on each part step by step for one of the two assigned elements (The other small group will do the same with the second element).

  

- It is suggested that each group member checks the other group’s work using the attached rubric before submitting the final document.
    

  

Group 1: Lithium and Gallium Group 5: __Chlorine__and Magnesium

Group 2: Vanadium and Silicon Group 6: Silicon and Boron

Group 3: Boron and Nitrogen Group 7: Carbon and Bromine Group 4: Potassium and Vanadium Group 8: Oxygen and Gallium

  

Part 1: Bohr Model (2 points)

1. Draw a Bohr Model for your element placing all the electrons in the appropriate energy levels.

NOTE: Use Part 2 of U2 CFU1 as a guide. Draw the nucleus as a solid sphere. There is no need to add protons & neutrons. (1 point each)

2. How many valence electrons does your element have? (½  point each) 7
    
3. Draw a Lewis Dot Diagram for your element. (½ pt each)

Part 2: Electron Arrangement  (4 points)

1. Write the ground state electron configuration for your element applying the Aufbau Principle learned in class. (1 point each)

1. Draw the orbital notation for your atom.  Be sure to: 
    
![[Pasted image 20240222111553.png]]

- label your orbitals (.5 pts each) 
    
- apply both Hund’s Rule and Pauli Exclusion Principle (1 point each)
    

3. How many unpaired electrons are there? (.5 pts each) 1 
    
4. Write the shorthand configuration (noble gas configuration) for your element.(1 point each) 
[Ne] 3s2 3p5
    

Part 3: Periodic Table Properties (7 points)

1. Determine the location of your element on the periodic table by stating its period number and its group number. (1 point each)    Period #:____  Group #:____
    
2. Classify your element as either a metal, nonmetal or metalloid.  Using your notes, state 2 general properties for the class you selected. (3 points: 1 point for the correct classification and 1 point each for a general property of that class of elements)
    
3. What is the family name of your element? Select from the following below: (1 point each)
    

| Alkali Metals | Alkaline Earth Metals | Transition Metals | Halogens |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Noble Gases | Nitrogen Family | Boron Family | Oxygen Family<br><br>(Chalcogens) |
| Carbon Family |  |  |  |

4. Using your notes, state 2 properties specific to your family of elements.  It cannot be the same properties you used above in 2b and must be specific to your family. (1 point each)
    

Note: If your element is in the Boron Family, Carbon Family, Nitrogen Family or Chalcogens, you will need to google properties of that family- they are not in your notes.
