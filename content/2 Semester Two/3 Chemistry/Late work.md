As far as late work goes, in the back, she collects late work. If you're absent the myp work is in the back. You can also get it if you lose something.

Over to the left of it is late work and test corrections. there is a blue basket labeled myp late work, and thats where you would put any late work. Over in a red basket there is a bunch of late work forms, you have to fill one out to submit something late. It is for quests that are late, cfus that are late which we have already been tested on. if its not been tested on yet then juts turn it in on canvas and shell just mark it late. 

before asking about late work compliment teacher and give nice conversation beforehand 


if you need to retake a test you do a practice test. in order to retake a test all the work has to be done for that unit. cant have any missing assignments. 

once you do the practice test we will go over your test and what you did wrong, and then you can come in after school or homeroom and make arrangements for you to retake a test. 

if you take pictures of the answer keys for the cfus to copy them its stupid becaues if you dont know how to do them then you're gonna do terrible on the test. make an effort to do the homework. dont copy. wa s there anything on the cfu 3 that we were not supposed to do.
