# L1 Energy & Specific heat
Energy is efined as the ability to do work or transfer heat energy

potential energy is energy at rest due to the position of an object, chemical potential energy is stored in the substance's bonds

kinetic energy is the energy of the motion of particles in a substance and is directly proportional to kelvin temperature. 

kinetics is defined as the study of how fast a reaction occurs 

we can measure how fast or slow a reaction takes place by looking at its reaction rate: Rate = change in amount of substance / change in time

Collision theory: these 3 conditions MUST be met for a reaction to occur
* Reactants must collide
* Collisions must be at the correct orientation
* Collisions must meet a minimum energy called Activation energy for the reaction to occur

Factors which affect reaction rate:
1. Nature of Reactant: Some substances are just more reactive than others
2. Surface area: as surface area increases, more effective collisions happen & rate increases
3. Concentrations of the reactants: as reaction concentration increaess, more effective collisions happen & the reaction rate increases. ( More reactants mean greater collision frequency )
4. Temperature: Molecules at a higher temperature have higher average speed so they move faster with greater collision frequency. Also, reactants must have minimal energy ( activation energy ) to collide. At higher temperatures, collisions have more energy, which contributes to required activation energy
5. Catalyst: substance that speeds up the rate of reaction without being used up. 
	1. Enzymes are catalysts in the body
	2. Catalysts lower activation energy by letting it proceed in a different way
6. Lower Ea ( activation energy ) = faster reaction

Heat of reaction ( deltaE ) ( Enthalpy change ) can be:
1. Endothermic ( delta E (delta H)) is positive: products have higher energy than reactants
2. Exothermic: (deltaE (deltaH)) is negative; products have lower energy than reactants
To calculate deltaH ( heat of the raction or change in enthalpy): subtract the final - initial energies; dependent on which direction you are looking at

Forward direction
deltaH deltaE = Eproducts + Ereactants

Thermochemical Equation: Balanced chemical equations that show the enthalpy change released or absorbed in a chemical reaction 
Enthalpy: heat released or absorbed during a chemical reaction; classified as positive or negative 

HOT PACK: 
an exothermic reaction is when the system releases energy; heat flows INTO a reaction and the surroundings get CLOSER
deltaH will be negative 

COLD PACK:
An endothermic reaction is when the system absorbs energy, heat flows into a reaction and the sruroundings get colder
deltaH will be positive 

Stoichiometry and enthalpy:
Once the deltaH is determined or given, it can be used in stoichiometric calculations
Use moles ( coefficients ) of reactants or products and the deltaH as a conversion factor

if you are solving for deltaH, you must use the sign. If you are solving for how much energy is absorbed or released, you do not have to put the sign.


a calorie is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of 1g by 1C ( 1 cal = 4.184 J ) 
most common units are Joules or kilojoules 

specific heat is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1g of a substance by 1C

specific heat ( c ) = heat in joules / ( mass ( m ) * change in temp ( deltaT) ) 

different substances have different specific heats
water has a specific heat of 4.184 J/gC. Iron has a specific heat of .4490 J/gC. Gold has a specific heat of .129 J/gC
The higher the specific heat the more energy it takes to change its temperature

q = heat ( joules )
m = mass ( g )
c = specific heat ( J/gC)
deltaT = change in temp 

# L2 Heat Calculations & Properties of Solids and Liquids

to calculate heat: 

q = m * C * deltaT

Properties of a Liquid:

particles more spread out than solid, somewhat close packing

particles are free to move past eachother; flow

incompressible

weaker attractions

variable shape and definite volume 

properties of a solid:

closest packing of molecules

vibrate in place; low kinetic energy of particles

incompressible

strong attractive forces

definite shape and definite volume

Endothermic: 

Kinetic energy must be put INTO the substance in order to increase the motions of the molecules so as to break the intermolecular forces holding the particles together 

melting: change of state from a solid to a liquid

vaporization ( boiling or evaporation) : change of state from a liquid to a gas 

sublimation: direct change of state from a solid to a gas 

Exothermic:

Kinetic Energy must be taken OUT ( removed ) from the substance for the molecules to slow down so that the intermolecular forces can begin to hold the particles together 

Freezing: change of state from a liquid to a solid

Condensation: change of state from a gas to a liquid

Deposition: direct change of state from a gas to a solid 

Temperature of state Changes:

freezing point = melting point 

condensation point is the temperature at which a gas turns into a liquid 

boiling point = condensation point 

all substances have their own specific freezing and boiling point, which makes this physical property a great way to identify an unknown substance 

# L3 Heating & Cooling Curves & Phase Diagrams

A heating / cooling curve is a diagram that shows how solids liquids and gasses change state when temperature is changed. Plateaus represent the changes of state. Slopes represent the pure states ( solid, liquid, or gas) 
at the plateaus, kinetic energy remains constant because temperature remains constant while potential energy changes 

![[Pasted image 20240510110519.png]]

Phase diagrams show how solids liquids & gases change state as both temperature and pressure changes. Crossing a line between states determines the change of state ( boiling, melting, etc ) 
a point directly on a line will identify the pressure and temperature ( boiling point, melting point, etc  ) of the phase change
triple point is the temperature and pressure in which all 3 states coexist 
critical point is the temperature and pressure in which a gas can no longer liquefy

Latent heat of fusion ( deltaHfus ) is the heat energy required to melt one gram of a solid at its melting point. q = deltaHfus * mass

Latent heat of solidification ( deltaHsolid ) is the heat energy lost when one gram of a liquid freezes to a solid at its freezing point. q = deltaHsolid * mass

Latent heat of vaporization is the heat to vaporize one gram of a liquid at its normal boiling point. q = deltaH vap * mass 

Latent heat of condensation is the heat energy released when one gram of a liquid forms from its vapor. q = deltaHcond * mass
