Element + Compound = Single Replacement 

SR Cl2 + LiI - > 
	^    ^
	|    compound
	diatomic
	element

in this one, its a non metal at the front, so its not one of the ones which start
with metal, so its gotta be hallide hallide, so its a 3D.

    D + BC -> BD + C

			  LiCl + I

compare metal to metal and nonmetal to nonmetal - same to same

magnesium and water 

NaCl + AgNO3-> NaNO3 + AgCl
  AB + CD   -> AD    + CB
