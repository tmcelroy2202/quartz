Molecular Polarity

Using the Structures Below:

1. Draw the Lewis Structure for each molecule in the correct shape.
    
2. Identify the bond polarity. If polar, draw the bond dipole arrows in the correct direction.
    
3. Label if the molecule is asymmetrical (bent, trigonal pyramidal) or symmetrical (linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral)
    
4. Based on your answers to steps 2 & 3, determine the moleculeâ€™s overall polarity. Polar if dipoles do not cancel or nonpolar if dipoles do cancel.
    
5. Then circle the lewis structure which is most polar.
