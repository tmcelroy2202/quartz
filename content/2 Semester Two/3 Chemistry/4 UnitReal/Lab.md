Were gonna have 5-6 stations with different chemical reactions you're gonna be mixing and do yourself. you need your goggles on the whole time, and if she puts out gloves, wear gloves. make sure when you get up from your seats you tuck in your chairs and backpacks so there is no tripping, no one should be sitting at the lab stations. bring lab tomorrow and it should be a good experiment.
