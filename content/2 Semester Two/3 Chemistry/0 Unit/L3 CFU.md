SIGNIFICANT FIGURES & ROUNDING

  

A.  Indicate the number of significant figures then round each to the number of significant figures indicated.

  

For example:

1.234 has 4 significant figures and, rounded to 2 significant figures, is 1.2

  

1. 0.6034 has 4 significant figures and, rounded to 2 significant figures, is 0.60

  

2. 12,700 has 3 significant figures and, rounded to 2 significant figures, is 13000

  

3. 12,700.00 has 7 significant figures and, rounded to 1 significant figures, is 10000

  

4. 0.000983 has 3 significant figures and, rounded to 2 significant figures, is 0.00098
  

5. 123342.9 has 7 significant figures and, rounded to 5 significant figures, is 123340

  

6. 6.023 x 1023 has 4 significant figures and, rounded to 2 significant figures, is 6.0 \* 10^23

  

7. .005600 has 4 significant figures and, rounded to 1 significant figures, is 0.006

  

8. 10000.5006 has 9 significant figures and, rounded to 5 significant figures, is 10001

  

9. 2.0 x 10-3 has 2 significant figures and, rounded to 1 significant figures, is 2

  

10. 3.456110 has 7 significant figures and, rounded to 3 significant figures, is 3.46

  
  

B.  Given calculations with the calculator answer, write the answers with the appropriate number of significant figures.

  

Example:

6.00 x 3.00 =  18 The answer should be 18.0

  

1. 23 + 46 =  69 The answer should be 69

  

2. 23.0 + 46.0 =  69 The answer should be 69.0

  

3. 253 + 345.8 =  598.8 The answer should be 599

  

4. 56 – 35 =  21 The answer should be 21

  

5. 56.00 – 35.0 =  21 The answer should be 21.0

  

6. 46 x 12 = 552 The answer should be 550

  

7. 3.24 x 5.63 =  18.2412 The answer should be 18.2

  

8.  (2.355 + 2.645) x 10.00 = 50 The answer should be 50.00

  

9. 654 ÷ 32 =  20.4375 The answer should be 20

  

10. .024 x .063 =  1.512 x 10-03 The answer should be 1.5 \* 10 \^ -3
